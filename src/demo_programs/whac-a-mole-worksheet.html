<div class="docTitle">Worksheet - Introducing Arrays with Whac-a-mole</div>

<p>Any array is a simple form of 'data structure' - which is a mechanism for holding multiple, related, data elements (or items)
    such that they may be read or modified all together, but also accessed individually.</p>

<p>We are going to write a simple version of the game 'whac-a-mole', using an array to represent a line of
    ten 'holes' from which a mole might briefly appear.</p>
</p>

<h3>Iteration 1 - Create an array of strings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Set the browser to full-screen mode, to give yourself as much room as possible.</li>
    <li>Select <b>File > New</b> to start a new program, then <b>File > Auto Save</b>, specifying where the file should be saved.</li>
    <li>Add a <el-kw>main</el-kw> routine, and within it write this instruction using the auto-completion 
        options as much as possible, because this reduces errors:
        <el-code-block>
            <el-statement class="ok" id="let5">
                <el-kw>let </el-kw>
                <el-field id="var6" class="ok" tabindex="0"><el-txt><el-id>holes</el-id></el-txt></el-field>
                <el-kw> be </el-kw>
                <el-field id="expr7" class="ok" ><el-txt><el-kw>new</el-kw> <el-type>Array</el-type>&lt;<el-kw>of</el-kw> <el-type>String</el-type>&gt;(<el-lit>10</el-lit>, "<el-lit>*</el-lit>")</el-txt><el-place><i>expression</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="">?</el-help></el-field>
            </el-statement>
        </el-code-block>
        <p>and noting the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The array is given a name just like any other named value.</li>
            <li>All elements within an array must be of the <i>same</i> type, and we have specified that this type is a string 
            by writing <el-type>Array</el-type>&lt;<el-kw>of</el-kw> <el-type>String</el-type>, but we could have created an <el-type>Array</el-type>&lt;<el-kw>of</el-kw> <el-type>Float</el-type>, for example.</li>
            <li>An array (unlike other data structures that will will discover in future) is created with a <i>fixed size</i>: in this case 
                <el-lit>10</el-lit>, to represent 10 holes.
            </li>
            <li>We must also specify an <i>initial</i> value to which each element must be set, which must be of the
            correct type - in this case a string, and we have chosen an asterisk "<el-lit>*</el-lit>" - to represent a mole.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add an instruction to print the holes, then run the program. Noting that the 10 elements of this array are printed successively, separated by a comma-and-space, and surrounded by square brackets.</li>
 </ul>
<h3>Iteration 2 - put a value into a specific element.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Change the instruction that defined the array so that, instead of an asterisk, each element is initialised to a single
    space - to represent an empty hole, and run the program to check that you are now just seeing spaces between the commas.</li>
  <li>Insert a new instruction immediately <i>after</i> the <el-kw>let</el-kw> instruction (select that instruction and press Enter to insert <el-code>new code</el-code> below it)
     and create this instruction:
    <el-code-block>
        <el-statement class="ok"><el-top><el-kw>call </el-kw>
        <el-field id="ident10" class="ok" tabindex="0"><el-txt><el-id>holes</el-id>.<el-method>put</el-method></el-txt></el-field>(<el-field id="args11" class="optional ok" tabindex="0"><el-txt><el-lit>1</el-lit>, "<el-lit>*</el-lit>"</el-txt></el-field>)</el-top>
        </el-statement>
    </el-code-block>
    noting that
    <ul>
        <li><el-method>put</el-method> is a procedure method that can be applied to an array.</li>
        <li>The syntax <el-id>holes</el-id>.<el-method>put</el-method> is known as a 'dotted method call' whereby
        you specify a thing (<el-id>holes</el-id>) and then <i>apply</i> (indicated by the dot) a method to it.</li>
        <li>When you typed the dot you would have seen all the procedures that may be applied to this array.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Run the program and make careful note of where the the asterisk (mole) has appeared.</li>
    <li>You might have been surprised that the mole <i>didn't</i> appear at the first hole. That's because the elements in an
        array are numbered from <i>zero</i>. So what number  the <i>last</i> element in an array of 10 element array should be 9.</li>

    <li><Address></Address> two more instructions similar to the existing <el-kw>call</el-kw>, but putting an asterisk in element numbers
        0 and 9, and run the program and check that it shows three moles in the expected places.</li>
    <li>Change the <el-lit>9</el-lit> to <el-lit>10</el-lit>. This will cause an error, which will
    be shown in the <b>Debug</b> tab, after which you will need to click on the <b>Documentation</b> tab to get back here.
    Run the program to test this and make sure you understand the error message, so that you recognise what is going on
    if you see this message unexpectedly in future.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Iteration 3 - display the array in a more useful way</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We have learned how to <i>write</i> an individual element using <el-method>put</el-method> but we can also 
    <i>read</i> an indivdual element by using an index. For example <el-code><el-id>holes</el-id>[<el-lit>5</el-lit>]</el-code>
    will access element number 5, and, assuming we have defined an integer value named <el-id>n</el-id> then 
    <el-code><el-id>holes</el-id>[<el-id>n</el-id>]</el-code> will read element number <el-id>n</el-id>.

</li>
    <li>In a game of Whac-a-mole we just want to present the 10 hole with or without a mole coming out of it.
        Also, we need to have the holes numbered because the player needs to be able to identify the hole number
        very quickly and press the corresponding digit on the keyboard. We can do this with a loop. Start by 
        delecting any existing <el-kw>print</el-kw> instructions. (To delete an instruction, select it by clicking on the keyword at the start of the instuction and then
        press <b>Ctrl-Delete</b> or <b>Ctrl-d</b>).</li>
    
    <li>As the First instruction of <el-kw>main</el-kw> add this instruction to label the holes:
        <el-code-block>
            <el-statement class="focused ok" id="print23" tabindex="0" title="Right-mouse-click or Ctrl-m to show context menu"><el-kw>print </el-kw><el-field id="expr24" class="optional ok" tabindex="0"><el-txt>"<el-lit>0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9</el-lit>"</el-txt><el-place><i>expression</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl></el-field></el-statement>
        </el-code-block>
    noting that there are <i>two</i> spaces between each digit.
    </li>
    <li>As the last line in <el-kw>main</el-kw> add a <el-kw>for</el-kw> loop naming the variable <el-id>n</el-id> 
    and counting from 0 to 9.</li>
    <li>Within the loop add this instruction:

        <el-code-block>
            <el-statement><el-top><el-kw>call </el-kw><el-field id="ident32" class="ok" tabindex="0"><el-txt><el-method>printNoLine</el-method></el-txt></el-field>(<el-field id="args33" class="optional ok" tabindex="0"><el-txt>"<el-lit></el-lit>{<el-id>a</el-id>[<el-id>i</el-id>]}<el-lit>  </el-lit>"</el-txt></el-field>)</el-top></el-statement>
        </el-code-block>
    noting that:
    <ul>
        <li><el-method>printNoLine</el-method> is a procedure that works a bit like <el-kw>print</el-kw> but does not print a newline afterwards.</li>
        <li>We are printing an 'interpolated string' so that hole number <el-id>n</el-id> is inserted into the String
            between the curly-braces (which will not, themselves, appear in the printed string)
        <li>There are two spaces after the close-brace - to match the two spaces between digit lables.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Run the program and check that you see see the labels for the holes and the moles appearing in just a few of them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Iteration 4 - put the mole in a random hole</h3>

    <h3> WHERE?</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>To make the mole(s) appear unpredictable, we need to generate a random integer in the range of 0 to 9. 
         So, add a new <el-kw>let</el-kw> instruction defining the name 
         <el-id>molePosition</el-id> with the value generated by the expression <el-code><el-method>randomInt</el-method></el-code>(<el-lit>0</el-lit>, <el-lit>9</el-lit>)</code>
    </li>
    <li>Change the instruction below this so that instead of putting the mole ( <el-code>"<el-lit>*</el-lit>"</el-code> )
     into a specific hole number, you put it into the hole number defined as <el-id>molePosition</el-id>.</li>
    <li>Run the program more than once and check that the mole <i>usually</i> appears at a different hole each time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Iteration 5 - Move the mole randomly, once a second</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When we want to repeat a piece of behaviour indefinitely, we use an 'indefinite' loop, which is a
            loop where the 'condition' for ending the loop <i>never</i> evaluates to <el-kw>false</el-kw>.
            So, after the last instruction within <el-kw>main</el-kw> insert a <el-kw>while</el-kw> instruction,
            putting the fixed value <el-kw>true</el-kw> into the 'condition' field.</li>
        <li> Cut all the other instructions within <el-kw>main</el-kw> except the initial definition of
            the <el-id>holes</el-id> array, and paste them into the <el-kw>while</el-kw> loop. To do this, 
            select the top-most instruction you want to move, then press <b>Ctrl-↓</b> to include successive
            instructions below it, and press <b>Ctrl-x</b> to cut them. Then select the <el-code>new code</el-code>
            within the <el-kw>while</el-kw> loop and paste in the cut instructions with <b>Ctrl-v</b>. 
            (You may also perform cut and paste from the context menu, which you access with <b>right-mouse-click</b>
             on an instruction).
        <li>If you try running the program now - noting that because the loop never exits you will need to press the 
            <b>Stop</b> button to be able to exit - you will see that the Display repeatedly <i>adds</i> new text 
        instead of over-writing it. We can fix this with a <el-kw>call</el-kw> to the <el-method>clearPrintedText</el-method> 
        pause. Add this as the last instruction within the loop then run again.</li>
        <li>Also, we need to slow things down by calling the <el-method>pause</el-method> procedure, which requires a length
            of pause to be specified as an argument (i.e. between the brackets after the procedure name). The length
            is specified in <i>milliseconds</i> so use a value of <el-lit>1000</el-lit> to start with. Add this instuction
            <i>before</i> the one that clears the text, then run again.</li>li>
        <li>The results should be better, but still not quite what we want. Instead of moving the mole, we are
            <i>adding</i> a mole each second, soon filling all the holes. So now, after clearing the printed text,
            call the <el-method>put</el-method> procedure method on <el-id>holes</el-id>to replace the mole at the current <el-id>molePosition</el-id>
            with an empty hole (a single space in quotes) - then run again. Hopefully, it's starting to look like a game - now
            we need to be able to interact with it.</li>
    </ul>
