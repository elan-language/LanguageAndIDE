# EXTENSIONS
# Change scoring so that a hit gains 3 points but every miss loses a point. Note that to detect a miss you must test for k isnt "" - otherwise you will be counting a no-key-press.
# Allow the user to select a difficult level (1-5, perhaps) at the start of the game. Use this figure to reduce the 'stop' time by 400ms for each level above 1.
