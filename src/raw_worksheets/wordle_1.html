    <h1>Step</h1>
    <p>We are going to create a working implementation of the Wordle puzzle.
        If you have never previously solved a Wordle puzzle, you should visit the 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">official Wordle site</a>
        and solve today's puzzle, so you know how it works.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Load 'wordle-start.elan' and run the program. On the <b>Display</b> you will see 
        a facsimile of the puzzle, and if you enter your first guess
        (five letters - using <b>Backspace</b> if you make a mistake - then <b>Enter</b>) each
        letter will be marked green, yellow, or grey. But if you continue with further guesses
        you will quickly discover that it marks <i>every</i> guess word with the same result!
        Thought this program has correctly implemented the <i>presentation</i>, and the
        <i>user interactions</i>, of the official puzzle, 
        it hasn't properly implemented the core logic of how guesses are marked.</li>
        <li>In the code, look at instruction number 75 - the <el-method>markAttempt</el-method>
        function. Comments state that the current implementation is just a 'stub' - the minimum code needed
        to allow the program to compile and run. It returns
        a five-character string, as expected: <code>2</code> for an 'in-place' match (green), 
        <code>1</code> for an 'out-of-place' match (yellow), or <code>0</code> for no match (grey). But
        it always returns the same mark, paying no attention to the two parameters: the 
        #<code>attempt</code> word (your guess) and the <code>target</code> word 
        (selected by the computer but normally hidden from the user).</li>
        <li>Immediately following the <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function you will see a <code>test</code>
            which has been 'ghosted'. Select the test and <b>unghost</b> (via the context menu: <b>Ctrl-m</b> or right-mouse-click).
             The tests will automatically run a couple of seconds later.
        <question>How many of the <code>assert</code> instructions within the test have failed?</question>
        </li>
        <li>Change the 'default' value to which the <code>mark</code> string is set, so that it returns a string of five zeroes.</li>
        <question>Which, if any, of the <code>assert</code> instructions within the tests now pass?</question>
        </ul>
</step>

<step>
    <ul>
        <li>If you were telling a person  how to mark an attempt word against a target word <i>manually</i>,
            you would probably tell them to look for any 'green' matches first. (It's more complicated to
            to it any other way.) In the <code>test</code> you can see that the first few (failing) tests are
            all looking just for green matches. So, your first task is to write an implementation that gets the four 
            'Only greens' tests passing.</li>
        <li>The <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function will need to set individual characters within
            the five-character <code>mark</code> string. The <el-method>setChar</el-method> function (instruction 73) is intended
            for this purpose, but notice that this also is a 'stub' implementation. So start by
        unghosting the <code>test</code> for <code>setChar</code> (immediately below the function),
        and then write a proper implementation of <code>setChar</code> to get those tests passing.</li>
        <hint>Key ideas</hint>
        <content>
            <ul>
            <li><code>String</code> is an 'immutable' type: you can't change its contents directly, 
        you must build a new string out of parts of the input one with necessary changes incorporated.</li>
        <li>Use 'index ranges'. If you are not familiar with these: in the <b>Help</b> tab look up <b>Library Reference - Value Types - String</b></li>
        <li>Build the string to be returned from three parts: the string up to the character to the changed;
            the new character; a copy of the original string <i>following</i> the character being changed.

            <code>str[something] + ch + str[something]</code>
            but you need to replace each <code>something</code> with a specified <i>range</i>.</li>
            <li>Pay particular attention to the documentation concering whether the 'bounds'
                when specifying ranges are 'inclusive' or 'exclusive'.

                <li>The range for the remaining of the string after, <i>but not including</i> character number <code>n</code>
                    is <code>n+1..</code></li>

    <li>With <el-method>setChar</el-method> working we can now turn back to <el-method>markAttempt</el-method>.
        Start by deleting the first comment - as it will be incorrect once you start the implementation.
        (You can either keep or discard the other comment.)
        Implement this function such that the first five <code>assert</code>s in the <code>test</code> pass (the default case 
        and four 'Only green' cases).

    <ul>
        <li>Now we will tackle the yellows. Underneath the <code>for</code> loop that you just created,
        create a second loop using the same values. (It might be tempting to try to process the greens and yellows
        within the same loop, but you would that to be much more difficult in the end.)</li>
        <li>Within the new loop add an <code>if</code> instruction as before, but for our first stab at this,
        use the condition that the <code>target</code> word <i>contains</i> the character of interest.</li>
        <li>If it does then set the corresponding character in <code>mark</code> to 1 for yellow.</li>
        <li>This first stab should get <i>most</i> (but not all) of the 'Yellow only' cases passing.
        However, it will also have caused an unwanted consequence.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>The problem is: letters that were marked green in the first loop, are being 'overwritten'
            by a yellow. In the second loop we need to exlude any characters that have already been 
            marked green. Attempt it now by modifying the <code>if</code> condition within in the second loop. You should
            get all the 'Green only' cases passing again, and <i>all except one</i> of the 'Yellow only'

         <question>Try removing the brackets around <code>(mark[n] isnt "2")</code>. 
            What happens. If you can, try to explain <i>why</i> this happens?</question>
         <question>Why is one of the 'Yellow only' cases still failing?</question>
        </li>
    </ul>
</step>
<step>
    <ul>
    <li>Answer to the previous two questions: 
    <ul>
        <li>The brackets are needed around <code>(mark[n] isnt "2")</code>
        to specify the priority between the <code>isnt</code> and the <code>and</code> operators. Without
        them the <code>and</code> is applied to the <code>"2"</code> and <code>target.contains(attempt[n])</code>,
        which are not compatible.)</li>
        <li>One of the 'Only yellows' <code>assert</code>s is still failing because the <i>both</i>
        the Xs in the attempt word are being marked yellow even though there is only one X in the target word.</li>
     </ul></li>
     <li>We need to keep a tally of which letters in the <code>target</code> word have already been 'used' (or matched) - for green, and for yellow.
        The easiest way to do this would be to blank out a character in the <code>target</code> word as it is used. However
        <code>target</code> is a parameter, and Elan (deliberately) does not allow you to <code>set</code> a parameter
        in a function. So, instead, at the top of the function, just below the existing definition of the <code>mark</code>
        define another variable named 'unused' and initialise it 
        to the value of <code>target</code>.

        <hint>Complete new instruction</hint>
        <content><code>variable unused set to target</code> to be added below <code>variable mark set to "00000"</code></content>
     </li>
     <li>
        Find the <i>two</i> places where <code>target</code> is currently referenced <i>within</i> the
         <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function and edit them to reference <el-code>unused</el-code>
         instead. Then <i>both</i> places where <code>mark</code> is being set, within the two <code>for</code> loops:
         add a new instruction, underneath each, to set the corresponding character in <code>unused</code> to a single
         empty space. When you have completed this, <i>all</i> tests for <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> should pass.

    <h3>Mission accomplished</h3>
    <p>Assuming that you have all the tests for <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> passing, you should be
    able to run the program and solve the Wordle puzzle. The computer will pick a different word
    each time you run the program.</p>
    <h3>Optional refinements</h3>
    If you have time, consider making small improvements to the game, for example.
    <ul>
        <li>Create a loop within <code>main</code> to solve a fixed number of puzzles in succession,
        and then allow the user to specify, at the start, how many puzzles.</li>
        <li>Keep track of how many of those puzzles the user solved within six attempts, and how many were unsolved.
            Print this at the end of the run e.g. 'You solved 7 out of 10 puzzles within six attempts'.
        </li>
        <li>For the puzzles successfully solved, keep track of the number of attempts taken and, at the end of the
            run of puzzle, calculate the average number of attempts, displayed to, say, 2 decimal places.
        </li>
        <li>Make it a two player game, where each player must solve the same number of puzzles (with the target
            words being different for each) and then the scores are compared at the end.
        </li>
    </ul>
