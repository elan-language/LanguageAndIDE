    <h3>Step 1: Getting started</h3>
    <p>From the <b>Demo</b> menu, access the <b>Merge lists</b> code,  then select <b>File > Auto Save</b> and complete the dialog to ensure that your <i>code</i> is always saved.
      Remember that you can use the <b>Undo</b> button (or <b>Ctrl-z</b>) to undo recent changes.</li>

      <ul>
       <li>Writing a recursive function means that in <i>one or more</i> places within your implementation of <el-method>merge</el-method>
      you will have an expression that itself makes use of the <el-method>merge</el-method> function - typically with
      a smaller, or simpler, version of the problem of the list.
    </li>
      <li>One of the first things to consider when writing a recursive function is the 'boundary' (or 'exit' or 'edge' condition)
        i.e. the specific condition(s) under which you have, or can derive, the result <i>without</i> needing to use <code>sort</code> recursively.
