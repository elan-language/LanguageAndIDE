<title>Worksheet - Random Walk</title>

<div class="docTitle">Worksheet - Random Walk</div>

<p>If you have never programmed before, this worksheet is a great way to start.
And if you have already done some programming you might still find this exercise interesting.</p>

<p>Our objective is to investigate the mathematical idea of a 'random walk'. 
Imagine that you are standing in the centre of a circle with a radius of 10 paces.
But instead of walking straight to the edge, with each pace you make a random turn
- of <i>up to</i> to 90 degrees left or right. How many paces will it take to reach the edge?
If the turning is truely random then each attempt will take a different number: for example, the picture below shows 
three such possible random-walk journeys:</p>

<p>But can we determine the <i>average</i> number of paces to reach the edge? Yes,
if we could perform the experiment many times. 
And it turns out that being able to predict the average length of a different kinds of
random walk has very significant applications in many different fields of study: 
physics, biology, ecology, economics ..., even computer science. 
(You may read more about this on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>So we are going to build just such a simulation.</p>

<h3>Iteration 1: Use 'Turtle graphics' to plot a non-random walk.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Start with <b>File > New > OK</b> and make sure the code editor has focus (white background) by clicking on it, or tabbing to it.</li>
    <li>From the new code options, press <b>m</b> to create an empty <el-kw>main</el-kw> routine.</li>
    <li>Within the main routine add a <el-kw>let</el-kw> instruction, and edit its two fields to look like this.
</ul>
