    <h3>1. Loading and running a program</h3>

<ul>
    <li>From the <b>Demo</b> menu (top-left of screen) select <b>Bubbles</b></li> to load an Elan code file into the editor.
    <li>Run the program by pressing the <b>Run</b> button (the white triangle at the top of the screen) and briefly observe its dynamic
        output on the <b>Display</b>. Notice that the 'status' panel (top right of the window) shows
        the program is currently <b>running</b>. Notice also that the code editor window now has a pale tint over it, indicating that
        it does not have focus.
    </li>
    <li>Some programs will stop automatically at a certain point, this one doesn't. 
        Stop the program now by pressing the <b>Stop</b> button (white square).</li>
    <li>Click anywhere within the code editor pane to give it the focus (white background).
        (Or you can navigate to it by pressing <b>Tab</b> repeatedly, until the code editor's background turns white). 
    <i>Remember that if the code editor has a tinted background it doesn't have focus and won't respond to
    your inputs.</i> 
    </li>
    <li>Before we move on to explore the code, if your mouse has a scroll-wheel then - with the focus on the
        code editor - hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key and scroll the mouse wheel, both ways. What is the effect?

<div class="step" id="step2">
    <h3>2. Reading code</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The code is made up of instructions</li>
        <li>Each instruction is numbered on the right hand side. These 'instruction' numbers are not part of the code itself -
            they play no part in what the code <i>does</i> - the editor adds the numbers to the code to make it easy for
            us to draw attention to a specific instruction.</li>
        <li>An instruction always starts with a 'keyword' which is coloured like <el-kw>this</el-kw> and is always lower-case. 
             Within <i>some</i> instructions you will see some additional keywords. 
             However, it is the <i>initial</i> keyword that defines the nature of the instruction.
             Thus we might refer to a `<el-kw>call</el-kw> instruction' or a 
        <el-kw>let</el-kw> instruction, or simply as 'a <el-kw>call</el-kw>' or 'a <el-kw>let</el-kw>'.</li>  
        <li>Find at least five different keywords that define instructions within this program - not including <el-kw>end</el-kw>
        (we'll explain that one shortly) - and enter them here:
        <textarea id="input2"> </li>         
        <li>A line that begins with a <el-comment>#</el-comment> ('hash symbol') and is coloured <el-comment>like this</el-comment> is
        called  a 'comment'. A comment is <i>not</i> an instruction - hence it does not have an instruction number - and plays no part in what the code <i>does</i>.
        Comments can provide additional information <i>about the code</i> for the human reader's benefit.
        At the top of file you will see comment that tells you which version of Elan you are using. 
        This version comment is always present at the top of an Elan code file - it cannot be edited, deleted, or moved.</li>
    </ul>
    <label class="done" for="done2">Step completed</label>
    <input type="checkbox" class="step-complete" id="done2"/>
</div>

<div class="step" id="step3">
    <h3>3. Selecting instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In order to edit, move, or delete, an instruction (we'll do all three of those, shortly)
            you first need to 'select' (highlight) it. There are several different ways to do this.</li>
        <li>Locate instruction number <el-fr>10</el-fr> on the right-hand side and click <i>on the number</i>. 
            This will <span style="background-color: var(--selection);">highlight</span>
            the whole of that instruction - including the instruction number. </li>
        <li>Now select instruction number 2, but this time, instead of clicking on the number, click
            on the initial keyword in that instruction (<el-kw>let</el-kw>).</li>
        <li>Press the cursor-down key (<b>&#x2193;</b>) which will select the next instruction.</li>
        <li>Notice that this instruction spans several lines on the screen - from <el-kw>for</el-kw>
        to the <el-kw>end for</el-kw>. This is known as a 'compound' instruction - it contains several
        other instructions - all of which are indented by two characters - just to make the structure
        clearer. All compound instructions start with a keyword and end with <el-kw>end</el-kw> followed
        by that initial keyword. Compound instructions can even contain other compound instructions which
        is sometimes called 'nesting'. How many different compound instructions can you identify in this
        code - enter only the initial keyword of each different kind: <textarea id="input3a"></li>
        <li>Press cursor-right to navigate <i>into</i> the <el-kw>for</el-kw>
        instruction, and then use the up/down keys. Also try the <b>Home</b> and <b>End</b> keys if your keyboard
        has them. Either way, how far can you move the highlight up and down
        from here <textarea id="input3b"></li>
        <li>Now press cursor left to go back <i>out</i>to the enclosing compound instruction, and then try 
            cursor up/down, <b>Home</b> and <b>End</b>. What you will discover is that up/own, <b>Home</b> and <b>End</b>
            apply to instructions within the same indentation level, and that you need to use left/right to
            change levels.</li> 
        </li>You can scroll to the bottom of the code using the scroll bar on the right of the editor, or the scroll-wheel if your
            mouse has one. Holding down the <b>Ctrl</b> button while using the scroll wheel will change the magnification of the text.</li>
    </ul>
    <label class="done" for="done3">Step completed</label>
    <input type="checkbox" class="step-complete" id="done3"/>
</div>

<div class="step" id="step4">
    <h3>4. Deleting or moving instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Select instruction number 10. Then delete the instruction by pressing <b>Ctrl-Delete</b> 
            (or <b>Ctrl-d</b> if your keyboard doesn't have a Delete key).
        The requirement for <b>Ctrl</b> is to reduce the risk of accidental deletion. Notice that all the instructions following
        the one deleted have been renumbered.</li>
        <li><i>In this case</i>, despite the deleted instruction, the program will still run. Run it and
        briefly describe the difference it has made to the behaviour of the program: <textarea id="input4"></li>
        <li>Restore the deleted instruction by pressing <b>Ctrl-z</b> (alternatively, you may  use the <b>Undo</b> button.</li>
        <li>Select the restored instruction number 10 again, and then press <b>Ctrl-&#x2193;</b>. Describe what this
            has done: <textarea id="input4a"></li>
        <li>What happens if you press <b>Ctrl-&#x2193;</b> <i>again</i>? <textarea id="input4b"></li>
        <li>Restore the original code, either by applying the opposite action (<b>Ctrl-&#x21931;</b>), or you may again just undo the action.</li>
    </ul>
    <label class="done" for="done4">Step completed</label>
    <input type="checkbox" class="step-complete" id="done4"/>
</div>
  
<!-- Fields  - identifying names - change 'b' to bubble -->
        <li>Highlight, via clicking or cursor-keys, instruction number <el-fr>5</el-fr> - the first <el-kw>call</el-kw> instruction.
        Then press <b>Ctrl-Delete</b> (or <b>Ctrl-d</b> if your keyboard doesn't have a delete key). This will delete that whole
        instruction and move the highlight onto the next instruction.(The requirement to use the <b>Ctrl</b> key is to reduce the risk of doing this accidentally).</li>
        <li>Restore the deleted instruction by clicking the <b>Undo</b> button at the top of the window, or by pressing <b>Ctrl-z</b>.(If in the next few steps
        you get into a complete mess, then remember that you can just reload the <b>Life</b> program from the <b>Demo</b> menu.)</li>
        <li>Now navigate to the <el-kw>procedure</el-kw> instruction immediately below the main, which defined a procedure named
            <el-method>fillRandom</el-method>. Delete this instruction,  noting that this also deletes all the instructions it contains.</li>
        <li>Notice that this new deletion has had a bigger impact: the status panel (top-right of the screen)
             now shows that the <b>Compile</b> status is no longer <b>ok</b> -
            indicating that <i>something</i> is now 'unknown'. In this case you can see where the problem is in the code, but in other
            cases it might not be directly in view. In such a case click on the the appropriate bar in the status panel, and this will
            take you to the first instruction with a problem.  In this case it is a <kw>call</kw> instruction that is trying to call
            the <el-id>fillRandom</el-id> procedure that has just been deleted. So restore the code to its original form.
        </li>
        <li>Selecting the main routine again (it might be already) now press <b>Ctrl-&#x2193;</b> three times, noting that
        this <i>moves</i> the main - together with all the instructions it contains - down below the next instruction that is
        <i>at the same level of indentation</i>. Press <b>Ctrl-&#x2191;</b> to move it back again (or undo the change).</li>
         <li>Still with the main routine selected, press <b>Ctrl-&#x2193;</b> twice noting that this <i>extends</i> the
        selection to include multiple instructions <i>at the same level of indentation</i>. You will find that having made
        such a selection, you can move, or delete them all together. Try it and then restore the original code.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>3. Discovering fields</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Within an instruction, the keywords that <i>define</i> the instruction are fixed - they deliberately cannot be edited or deleted.
        But most instructions contain 'fields' that can be edited. Look for example at the first variable definition within the main routine.
        If you mouse-click on the word 'grid' you will see that this piece of text changes background colour and shows a thin black outline
        to indicate that it has the focus. This is a 'field'.</li>
    <li>When a field is highlighted you can navigate and edit the code within that field like a standard text-editor, using &#x2190;,&#x2192;, <b>Home</b>, <b>End</b>. <b>Delete</b>, and <b>Backspace</b>,
    and by selecting, cutting, copying, and pasting with <b>Ctrl-x</b>, <b>Ctrl-c</b>, <b>Ctrl-v</b>.</li>
    <li>Similarly if you click  anywhere after the <el-kw>set to</el-kw> keyword you will see that the remainder of the text forms another field.
        Code <i>within</i> fields can be freely edited, like normal text, though depending on what you do to the text such changes may result in errors
            - as indicated by a change in background colour and a change in the status panel, sometimes accompanied by a message. Try a few changes,
        reverting to the original code each time. We are not concerned, right now, with the meaning of these errors  - just with understanding
        which parts of code you can edit and how.</li>
    <li>Another way to select fields is to navigate first to an <i>instruction</i> of interest.
    With the instruction highlighted pressing the <b>Tab</b> key will select the next <i>field</i> and then cycle back to selecting the whole
    instruction. (<b>Shift-Tab</b> does the same thing in reverse.)</li>
    <li>After experimenting with editing fields, restore the original code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Inserting new instructions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Select the first instruction within the main, and press <b>Enter</b>, which will insert a 'selector' underneath with a grey background.
        This selector indicates the various types of instruction that may legitimately be inserted <i>at this location</i> - represented by
        the starting keyword in each case. The list keywords shown in the select will vary according to where you are within the code.</li>
    <li> Press <b>p</b> to insert a <el-kw>print</el-kw> instruction. Notice also that underneath the new instruction, it says 'new code',
    indicating that further instructions may be added there. </li>
    <li>Note that the letter <b>p</b> was sufficient to create the <el-kw>print</el-kw> instruction because only one of the keywords shown began
        with that letter. In some circumstances, the first letter will narrow the selection, and further letters are needed to match just
        one option.</li>
    <li>The newly-created <el-kw>print</el-kw> instruction has a single field into which you can enter a valid expression, and there is also
        a new drop-down list suggesting possible things you could add into that field. However, the <i>grey</i>
    background to this field indicates that this particular field is <i>optional</i> - it may be left blank, which we will do in this case.</li>
    <li>So, instead of writing into this field, just press <b>Enter</b>, which takes you to the next line, noting that the 'new code'
    line now has focus, and is again offering you instructions to select from.</li>
    <li>Ignore this, and instead cursor-up twice to select the <el-kw>variable</el-kw> instruction again.
        From there press <b>Shift-Enter</b> to insert another new code selector, this time <i>above</i> the instruction you were on.</li>
    <li>If you realise that you don't need to insert new code, then if a new code selector has focus then you can delete it like any instruction.
        Or you can press the <b>Trim</b> button (above the code editor), which will remove <i>all</i> unused new code selectors - except
        in a few places where new code is <i>expected</i> - for example within a compound instruction that currently contains no other instructions.</li>
    <li>Restore the program to its original version, by undoing your recent changes, or re-loading the demo.</li>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Cutting & Pasting instructions</h3>

<ul>
    <li>If you highlight an instruction and press <b>Ctrl-x</b> the editor will cut the instruction
        (including any other instructions it contains, if it is compound) and put
    it into the clipboard.</li>
    <li>This will also work if you select multiple adjacent instructions (as shown earlier).</li>
    <li>The instruction(s) in the clipboard may be pasted onto a new code selector elsewhere in the
        code. So either navigate to an existing new code selector, or insert one (see above) where you want to
        paste the instructions. The press <b>Ctrl-v</b> to paste. Note that this paste command will work only
            if:
            <ul>
                <li>There is at least one instruction in the clipboard.</li>
                <li>The instruction(s) to be pasted are valid for the location. In other words
                    each of the types of instruction to be pasted are shown (as initial keywords)
                    on that new code selector.
                </li>
            </ul>
        If pasting is unsuccessful a pop-up message box will appear.
    </li>
    <li>(It is not currently possible to <i>copy</i> and paste whole instructions.
        That capability will be added in a future version.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Outlining</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Press the button (above the code editor) marked <b>+/-</b>. This collapses the code to an outline. All the code is still there - so the
    program will still run - but some code is hidden from view. All compound instructions have been reduced to just their top line, with a plus
    alongside it. This can be very helpful in navigating around a longer program. It is also useful, though, to give you a high-level
    summary of a program that you are looking at for the first time - so you can see the main components of the code. Pressing the button again
    will expand the code.
</li>
    <li>Double clicking on a specific plus sign, or selecting that instruction pressing <b>Ctrl-o</b> ('o' for 'outline') will expand
    that collapsed instruction, and the same keys will collapse it again. Note that when an instruction is expanded, it may contain
    further collapsed instructions. To expand all collapsed areas you can either use <b>Ctrl-Shift-o</b> (i.e. <b>Ctrl-O</b>) - or
    use the outline button. (Sometimes, when the code is <i>partially</i> collapsed to an outline, you might need to do this twice
    to get to the presentation that you want.)
</li>
    <li>The background for the plus sign on each collapsed instruction should be green, but if you had any errors or warnings in the code, this would be reflected in
    the background colour of the plus sign. (Though remember that clicking on the status bar would also take you to the first error/warning,
    expanding the outline as needed.)
</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Finish</h3>

<p>You have now used most of the features of the code editor - both to navigate and to change code.
    So you are ready to move on to the next worksheet, where you will learn how to create a program from scratch.</p>

<p>Meantime, please note that the various keyboard and mouse commands recognised by the editor are
    summarised in the <b>IDE Reference</b> guide. Open that document from the <b>Help</b> tab, and
    look for these entries:
    <ul>
    <li>Navigation - using the keyboard</li>
    <li>Mouse operation - quick reference'</li>
    </ul>
