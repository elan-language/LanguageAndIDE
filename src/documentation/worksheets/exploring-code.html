    <h3>1. Loading and running a program</h3>

<ul>
    <li>From the <b>Demo</b> menu (top-left of screen) select <b>Bubbles</b>.
    <li>Some programs will stop automatically at a certain point when they are run, this one doesn't. So when you run it
        by clicking the white, triangular <b>Run</b> button, you will need to stop it by clicking
        the white, square <b>Stop</b> button next to it. So now go ahead and run the program for
        a few seconds only, then stop, and click the <b>Worksheet</b> tab to return to here.</li>
    <li>Notice that the code editor window (left of screen) now has a tint over it - 
        so click somewhere on white space within the code editor pane to give it the focus (white background).
        <i>Remember that if the code editor has a tinted background it doesn't have focus and won't respond to
    your inputs.</i></li>
    <li>If your mouse has a scroll-wheel then - with the focus on the
        code editor - hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key and scroll the mouse wheel, both ways. What is the effect?

<div class="step" id="step2">
    <h3>2. Reading code</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The code is made up of instructions</li>
        <li>Each instruction is numbered on the right hand side. These 'instruction' numbers are not part of the code itself -
            they play no part in what the code <i>does</i> - the editor adds the numbers to the code to make it easy for
            us to draw attention to a specific instruction.</li>
        <li>An instruction always starts with a 'keyword' which is coloured like <el-kw>this</el-kw> and is always lower-case. 
             Within <i>some</i> instructions you will see some additional keywords. 
             However, it is the <i>initial</i> keyword that defines the nature of the instruction.
             Thus we might refer to a '<el-kw>call</el-kw> instruction' or 'a 
        <el-kw>let</el-kw> instruction, or simply 'a <el-kw>call</el-kw>' or 'a <el-kw>let</el-kw>'.</li>  
        <li>Find at least five different keywords that define instructions within this program - not including <el-kw>end</el-kw>
        (we'll explain that one shortly) - and enter them here:
        <textarea class="question" id="input2"></textarea></li>         
        <li>A line that begins with a <el-comment>#</el-comment> ('hash symbol') is
        called  a 'comment'. A comment is <i>not</i> an instruction - hence it does not have an instruction number - and plays no part in what the code <i>does</i>.
        Comments provide additional information <i>about the code</i> for the human reader's benefit.
        At the top of file you will see comment that tells you which version of Elan you are using. 
        This version comment is always present at the top of an Elan code file - it cannot be edited, deleted, or moved.</li>
    </ul>

    <input type="checkbox" class="step-complete" id="done2"/>
</div>

<div class="step" id="step3">
    <h3>3. Selecting instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In order to edit, move, or delete, an instruction (we'll do all three of those, shortly)
            you first need to 'select' (highlight) it. There are several different ways to do this.</li>
        <li>Locate instruction number <el-fr>11</el-fr> on the right-hand side and click <i>on the number</i>. 
            This will <span style="background-color: var(--selection);">highlight</span>
            the whole of that instruction - including the instruction number.</li>
        <li>Now select instruction number 14, but this time, instead of clicking on the number, click
            on the initial keyword in that instruction (<el-kw>call</el-kw>). You can select an
            instruction either way - it makes no difference.</li>
        <li>Press the cursor-down key (<b>&#x2193;</b>) which will select the next instruction (or comment).
            And then cursor-up to return to the one above.</li>
        <li>This time press <b>Shift-&#x2193;</b>. 
            What difference does holding down the <b>Shift</b> make? <textarea class="question" id="3a"></textarea></li>
        <li>Try pressing cursor-up and down (with no <b>Shift</b>) a few times. 
            How far can you move the highlight this way? <textarea class="question" id="3b"></textarea></li>
        <li>Now press the cursor-left key and you will see that this shifts the highlight to instruction
            number 10 - an <el-kw>if</el-kw> instruction - and that the highlight has a more complex shape.</li>
        <li><el-kw>if</el-kw> is an example of a 'compound' instruction: it <i>contains</i>
        other instructions, all of which are indented by two characters, just to make the structure
        clearer. All compound instructions start with a keyword and end with <el-kw>end</el-kw> followed
        by that initial keyword. (This is why a line beginning <el-kw>end</el-kw> is <i>not</i> an
        instruction in its own right.) Compound instructions can even contain other compound instructions which
        is sometimes called 'nesting'. How many different compound instructions can you identify in this
        code - enter only the initial keyword of each different kind? <textarea class="question" id="input3c"></textarea></li>
        <li>Now press cursor-right to move back to the <i>first</i>> instruction <i>within</i>
            the outer (compound) instruction. Then press cursor left and right a few times to explore the limits of how far you
            can move the highlight in this direction.</li>

</div>

<div class="step" id="step4">
    <h3>4. Deleting or moving instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Select instruction number 11 (a <el-kw>call</el-kw>). Then delete this instruction by pressing <b>Ctrl-Delete</b> 
            - or <b>Ctrl-d</b> if your keyboard doesn't have a Delete key.
        (The requirement for <b>Ctrl</b> is to reduce the risk of accidental deletion.)
         Notice that all the instructions following the one deleted have been renumbered.</li>
        <li><i>In this case</i>, despite the deleted instruction, the program will still run. Run it and
        briefly describe the difference it has made to the behaviour of the program? 
        <textarea class="question" id="input4a"></textarea></li>
        <li>Restore the deleted instruction by pressing <b>Ctrl-z</b> 
            (alternatively, you may  use the <b>Undo</b> button).</li>
        <li>Select instruction number 11 again, and then press <b>Ctrl-&#x2193;</b>. Describe what this
            has done? <textarea class="question" id="input4b"></textarea></li>
        <li>What happens if you press <b>Ctrl-&#x2193;</b> <i>again</i>?
<textarea class="question" id="input4c"></textarea></li>
        <li>Restore the original code, either by applying the opposite action (<b>Ctrl-&#x2191;</b>),
             or you may again just undo the action.</li>
    </ul>
    <label class="done" for="done4">Step completed</label>
    <input type="checkbox" class="step-complete" id="done4"/>
</div>

<div class="step" id="step5">
    <h3>5. Editing instructions</h3>
    <p>So far the changes we have made involved moving or deleting a <i>whole</i> instruction.
        When you start to write programs from scratch (in the next worksheet) you will find that
        you will need this ability. However, more commonly you will need to edit code <i>within</i>
        an instruction, so we'll do that now.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In this program, each bubble is updated - in position and size - multiple times per second, 
            but as you can read from the comment above instruction 11 - with each update
            there is a 5% chance of it bursting, which will reduce its <el-id>radius</el-id> to 0 (instruction 11), and its
            position back to the bottom of the screen (instruction 12). 
            What might happen if we reduce that probability of bursting?</li>
        <li>The 5% chance is represented by the value <el-lit>0.05</el-lit> in instruction 10.
            There are two ways to get the focus onto this value: either click directly on that value, or
            select instruction 11, and then press <b>Tab</b>. Either way, you will end up with
            <i>part</i> of the instruction being highlighted:
            <el-code><el-field id="expr31" class="selected focused ok" tabindex="0"><el-txt><input spellcheck="false" data-cursorstart="15" data-cursorend="15" size="14" style="width: 15ch" value="random() &lt; 0.05"></el-txt><el-place><i>condition</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="Click to open Help for this field"><a href="documentation/LangRef.html#ExpressionField" target="doc-iframe">?</a></el-help></el-field></el-code>
        </li>
        <li>This highlighted area is a 'field'. Fields are the <i>editable</i> parts of an instruction. 
        Most instructions define one, two, or three fields (<el-kw>main</el-kw> is an exception, having no fields).
        The rest of the instruction is made up of keywords and, less-commonly, punctuation symbols. 
        These <i>fixed</i> parts cannot be edited because they define the essential nature of the instruction
         - they may only be removed by deleting the whole instruction as you have previously done. 
         IBy constrast, in most programming languages you can edit every character in the code,
          but this very commonly leads to errors ('syntax errors') that are often hard to diagnose.</li>
        <li>Whennever a field has focus, it has a coloured background, a thin black outline, and
            a flashing line to indicate the cursor position - which defaults to the right-hand end.</li>
        <li>Press <b>Backspace</b> <i>once</i> to delete the 5, and then type 1 (thereby reducing the chance to 1%) 
            and then press <b>Enter</b>. The field returns to its unselected form, 
            and - because this was the <i>last</i> field (in this case the <i>only</i> field)
        for the instruction, the focus has now moved on to the next instruction or comment. Run the program
        again. What difference do you notice? <textarea class="question" id="input5a"></textarea></li>
        <li>Select that same field again, and this time <b>Backspace</b> 4 times to delete the whole value (<el-lit>0.01</el-lit>).
        Now the field's background colour will have changed, and also the 'Parse' status in the 'status panel'
        (top-right corner of the screen) will have changed - both indicating that a field
        is incomplete. Also a 'prompt' (white text) indicates that a 'value or expression' is expected.
        Try typing in <el-lit>.01</el-lit> (without a leading <el-lit>0</el-lit> ). 
        .The field background - and the parse status - go red, and indicate that this is an invalid entry 
        (because Elan, like many languages, requires that fractional numbers must begin with a digit, not a decimal point).
        So correct the entry to <el-lit>0.01</el-lit> 
        - you can use the cursor keys to move the cursor, you don't have  to delete all the characters.</li> 
        <li>A good rule of thumb (usually, but not 100% correct, but ) is that if you are 
        typing code into a field, and it goes red, use <b>Backspace</b> to remove characters until it turns
         green or amber and try to work out why the one character that made it go red was wrong. 
         Identifying the cause of some errors takes time to learn, but at least with this editor you do get
         the error message as soon as you type one wrong character.</li>
    <li>To test this skill, select instruction number 17  and press <b>Tab</b> to select the first field which
         specifies the <el-method>pause</el-method> and then again to select the second field 
         which holds the value <el-lit>50</el-lit>.
          Edit this value to <el-lit>250</el-lit></li>
     <li>From the field, press <b>Tab</b> multiple happens. What happens? 
        <textarea class="question" id="input5b"></textarea></li>
     <li>Run the program to test that it is much slower. 
        Leave the change in place as that will help us in our next step.</li>

<div class="step" id="step6">
<h3>6. Inserting new instructions</h3>
<p>We are now going to insert a new instruction to make an audible noise when a bubble bursts.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select instruction number 17, and then hit <b>Enter</b>. 
        This will insert a 'selector', where new code can be entered, <i>below</i> the current instruction
        and the focus will have moved there. 
        The selector shows the initial keyword for each kind of instruction
        that may legitimately be inserted <i>at this location</i>. 
        You select the instruction by starting to type it.
        in <i>most</i> cases just the first letter is needed; in a few cases more characters are needed to 
        distinguish between instructions that start the same way.</li>
    <li>Type <b>c</b> to insert a <el-kw>call</el-kw> instruction. You will see that the <i>fixed</i> code
    has been added, the focus has shifted to the first field, and there is already a pop-up menu of options.
    What we want is the procedure named <el-method>tone</el-method>, but as that would be a long way down
    the list, just type a <b>t</b> and now you will see <el-method>tone</el-method> in the list of matching options
    - at the top, in this case. Cursor-down to select <el-method>tone</el-method> and press <b>Enter</b>
    to insert it in the field. You should
        always use the pop-up options <i>where you can</i> not only because it saves typing, but because
        it reduces errors.</li>
    <li>Press <b>Enter</b> again to shift focus to the second field - between the brackets. The field
        will indicate what is expected (in white text) - in this case, three values representing:
        <ul>
            <li>The duration of the tone, in milliseconds.</li>
            <li>The frequency of the tone, in Hz.</li>
            <li>The volumne of the tone</li>
        </ul>
        separated by commas. Type this:  <el-code>10, 500, 0.1</el-code> and hit <b>Enter</b>.
        Assuming you haven't made an error in the typing, the status panel (after a second or two)
        will show that all is good. So run the program.</li>
    <li>If you don't hear <i>anything</i>, check the sound settings on your computer. And, if you
        are working in a classroom, <i>please turn the volume as low as possible while still audible</i>.
            Once you can hear something, describe what you hear? 
            <textarea class="question" id="input6a"></textarea>.</li>
    <li>We got a result. The very short duration means that it sounds more like a 'click' than a tone, but 
        that's OK. But the clicks shouldn't be regular - they should be <i>irregular</i>, occurring
        whenever a bubble bursts. We've put the instruction in the wrong place! It needs to be
        just under instruction number 12, which simulates the burst. However, we can't just move
        the instruction upwards as we did before, because it needs be moved inside
        another compound instruction. So instead we will cut and paste it.</li>
     <li>Selected new instruction (number 18) then press <b>Ctrl-x</b> to
    cut it - into the (invisible) clipboard. Now select instruction number 12 and hit <b>Enter</b> to
        create a new code selector underneath it. <i>You can only ever paste instructions
        onto a new code selector, in focus</i>. Then press <b>Ctrl-v</b> to paste. Assuming that the
        instruction(s) you are trying paste are valid for the target location (as it will be in this case)
        the cut code will reappear - and instructions renumbered accordingly.</li>
    <li>Run the program and hopefully the clicks will now be irregular. If it is not clear
        that they <i>do</i> correspond with burst bubbles, slow down the program execution
        again by increasing the length of the pause in the (now) instruction number 16.
    </li>
    <li>Lastly you may already have noticed that underneath instruction 18 you have been left with another
        selector for new code (it just shows as <el-code>new code</el-code> when it does not have focus).
        When entering or editing a longer program it is not uncommon to end up with several of these 
        surplus-to-requirements. They can selected and deleted individually, but the the <b>Trim</b>
        button above the editor will remove all that can be removed. (Any that it leaves indicate places where
        further instructions are expected - because the code would make no sense without them).
    </li>
