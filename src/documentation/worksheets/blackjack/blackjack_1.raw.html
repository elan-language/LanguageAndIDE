<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: learning the rules of Blackjack</h1>
      <p>Watch the first video:</p>

      <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 72.67833109017496%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/3dca2b1ec6384176aaf85e1b60f6ce1d" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

      Now <load file="blackjack_1begin.elan">Load the starting code</load> and immediately use <b>file > auto save</b> the
     <i>code</i> to your local file storage: because you will be making changes and want to ensure that your changes are saved.
    
      <p>When you run the program, the <b>display</b> tab will be shown in place
      of this worksheet, you can flip between them by clicking on the tab headings.</p>

      <p>So, run the program now, either:
        <ul>
          <li>using the mouse, by clicking on the <b>run</b> button at the top of the screen, <i>or</i></li>
          <li>using the keyboard, by pressing <b>Ctrl+r</b></li>
        </ul>
      and play exactly 10 rounds of Blackjack.</p>

      <p>Make sure that you have grasped the following points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most cards have a obvious numeric value. The Royal cards - Jack, Queen, King - each have
        the value 10. An Ace is special: it can be valued at 11, or at 1. 
        An Ace valued at 11 is known as a 'soft Ace'.
        If a dealt card takes the hand total <i>over</i> 21 then a soft Ace is automatically devalued to 1.
        <li>The aim is to  get the value of your hand as close to 21 as you can - but if drawing a card causes
          the total to go over 21 then (unless you have a 'soft Ace') you will be 'BUST'
          and your turn is over.</li>
      
      <li>If the first two cards of any player total <i>exactly</i> 21 - which would require one Ace, and one Royal or 10 card -
         then you have 'BLACKJACK' - the best hand possible - so no further action is needed from you.</li>
      <li>When all hands have finished playing, the outcome is determined, points swapped as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>If a player is BUST then 1 point is passed from them to the dealer <i>even the dealer is also BUST</i>.</li>
          <li>If a player has BLACKJACK then they gain 2 points from the dealer <i>unless</i> the dealer
          also has BLACKJACK, in which case it is a draw.</li>
          <li>else, if the player is STANDING and the dealer has BLACKJACK the dealer gains one point from the player.</li>
          <li>else, if the player is STANDING and their hand total is greater than the dealer's, the player gains one point from the dealer.</li>
          <li>else, if the player is STANDING and their hand total is the same as the dealer's, it is a draw.</li>
          <li>else, if the player's total is less than the dealer's, the dealer gains one point from the player.</li>
        </ul> 
      </li>
      <li>This program uses deck of multiple packs of cards: so there is a small chance that the same card may appear on
        screen more than once.</li>
    </ul>
    <question>After playing 10 rounds, how many points did you, and the dealer, end up with?</question>
    <p>If you have not already exited the program, click <b>stop</b>.</p>

<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: adding a new instruction</h1>

  <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 64.67065868263472%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/b7376d0f99cd421e810936d1841ba118" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
  <p>Your first task is to turn the program into a two-player game (not counting the dealer, played by the computer):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Near the top of <code>main</code>, find this instruction:
    <codeblock>call game.addPlayer(new HumanPlayer("Player A", 1000))</codeblock>
    and immediately <i>below</i> it insert a new <code>call</code> instruction.</li>
    <li>Into the <i>two</i> editable fields type in the same code that you see in the instruction immediately above it,
    <i>except</i> that instead of <code>"Player A"</code>, write <code>"Player B"</code>. Note that:
    <ul>
      <li>your text will initially be black, but it will be coloured once you leave the field</li>
      <li>a drop-down list will offer you some 'auto-completion' options, which can save typing and
        errors. You can select an option with the mouse or with the cursor ↑↓ keys and <b>Enter</b>.</li>
      <li>You might see a message appear on the right, but you can ignore it for now, unless it is coloured red 
        (you will also then see the word <b>invalid</b> or <b>error</b> appear) in which case you should <b>Backspace</b>
        to correct the mistake. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When you have completed the new instruction, <b>run</b> the program, and take responsibility for both <b>Player A</b>
    and <b>Player B</b> (or, if you are pairing with another person, control one each).</li>
  </ul>
  <question>When does the dealer play, now ?</question>
</step>

<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: modifying an existing instruction</h1>
  <ul>
    <li> Go back to the instruction that creates <b>Player A</b> and <i>above it</i>insert a <code>let</code> instruction
      and note that this features two editable fields.</li>
    <li>In the first field enter <code>name1</code> and in the second field type in the following code
    using the auto-completions to help <code>inputString("Enter name for first player")

    Going back to the first field, try deleting the contents and typing <code>Name1</code>
    <question>What message do you see within the code editor?</question>
    <question>And what do you observe in the 'status panel' - at the top of the screen, just to the right of the code editor?</question>
    Then revert the field back to <code>name2</code>.</li>
    <li>Select the instruction below this - in other words the one that you added previously - and <b>Tab</b> to the second
    field. Edit the contents, replacing the literal string <code>"Player A"</code> with <code>name2</code> 
    (no quotation marks because this is an <i>identifier</i> that holds a string, not a literal string).</li>
    <li>Run the program. When asked, type in your own first name, finishing with the <b>Enter</b> key.
      <question>Has the name you entered made a difference?</question>
      <question>There is an unwanted 'side effect' on the screen - what is it?</question>
    </li>
    <li>To fix the unwanted side effect, insert the following new instruction immediately<i>after</i> the second player is created and added to the game:
    <code>call clearPrintedText()</code></li>
    <li>Now change the program so that it asks the user to enter a name for the <i>second</i> player, this time using
      the identifier <code>name2</code>.</li>
    <li>Run the program again, and confirm that you can now name both players.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <question>What would happen if you define the second identifier as <code>name2</code>, but in the next line
  you were to write <code>name1</code>? (If you need to check, run the program) </question>
  <question>And what if the the second identifier was still <code>name2</code> but you used <code>name3</code>
  in the following instruction? This time, can you even run the program to try it?</question>
</step>

<final><h1>Congratulations! You have completed this worksheet</h1>

<p>You have learned:
<ul>
  <li>How to load, run, and stop a program</li>
  <li>How to recognise the different kinds of instructions that make up a program, including compound instructions, which contain other instructions.</li>
  <li>How to navigate around the program, selecting different instructions in order to draw attention to them and as a prelude to modifying them.</li>
  <li>How to insert new instructions, delete instructions, and to undo changes when they didn't do what you wanted.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>In the next worksheet - Blackjack 2 - you'll start to do some real programming, by defining and implementing the logic
  for a fully-automated Blackjack player - and then in the Blackjack 3 worksheet, pitting different automated players
  against each other for thousands of games, and using the outcome to refine the strategies.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you have time, we recommend that you watch the following additional videos - that offer
  further techniques for navigating and editing instructions. Practice the techniques shown in each video, either while it is running,
or immediately afterwards.</p>
