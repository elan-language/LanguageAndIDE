<title>Blackjack 1: exploring the Blackjack program and making small changes</title>
<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: learning the rules of Blackjack</h1>
    <p>Your first task is to make sure that you understand how the game
      works, and - since there are many minor variations on the game - the rules of this specific implementation.</p>
    
      <p>Watch the first video:</p>

      <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 72.67833109017496%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/3dca2b1ec6384176aaf85e1b60f6ce1d" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

      <p><load file="blackjack_1begin.elan">Load the starting code</load> and then immediately use <b>file > auto save</b> the
      code to your local file storage, because you will be making changes and want to ensure that your changes are saved.</p>
    
      <p>When you run the program, the <b>display</b> tab will be shown in place
      of this worksheet, you can flip between them by clicking on the tab heading.</p>

      <p>Run the program now either:
        <ul>
          <li>using the mouse, by clicking on the <b>run</b> button at the top of the screen, <i>or</i></li>
          <li>using the keyboard, by pressing <b>Ctrl-r</b></li>
        </ul>
        and play exactly 10 rounds of Blackjack in the same manner as on the video - flipping back to this worksheet between rounds
        - to make sure that you have understood the following points.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All players are dealt two cards to begin with. 
        One of the dealer's two cards is dealt face down - and is only revealed when the dealer starts their turn.</li>
      <li>Most cards have a numeric value (e.g. '7'). The Royal cards - Jack, Queen, King - each have
        the value 10. An Ace is special: it can be valued at 11, or at 1. An Ace valued at 11 is known as a 'soft Ace'. 
        So if a player's first two cards are <i>both</i> Aces then the starting hand total is counted as 12 (rather than 22).</li>
      <li>If the first two cards of any player total 21 - which would require one Ace, and one Royal or 10 card -
         then you have 'BLACKJACK' - the best hand possible - and so no further action is needed from you.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, when it is your turn you have the option to 'draw' another card - by hitting the <b>d</b> key - or
        to 'stand' - by hitting the 's' key.</li>
      </li>The aim is to  get the value of your hand as close to 21 as you can - but if drawing a card causes
        the total to go over 21, then if you have a soft Ace (see above), the Ace is automatically de-valued to 1. 
        If your  total would exceed 21 and you <i>don't</i> have a soft Ace (see above), then you are 'BUST' and you have no further role - for this round.</li>
      <li>
      <li>When your status changes either to STANDING or BUST then play passes to the the next player or -
        if you are the last or only player - to the dealer.<li>
      <li>The dealer now plays out their hand, initially turning the hidden card face up and then following fixed rules about
         when to stand and when to draw.</li>
      <li>When all players, including the dealer, have finished their turn, the outcome is determined, and 
        points are passed between each player and the dealer as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>If a player is BUST then 1 point is passed over to the dealer <i>even the dealer is also BUST</i>.</li>
          <li>else, if a player has BLACKJACK then they gain 2 points from the dealer <i>unless</i> the dealer
          also has BLACKJACK, in which case it is a draw and no points are exchanged.</li>
          <li>else, if the player is STANDING and the dealer has BLACKJACK the dealer gains one point from the player.</li>
          <li>else, if the player is STANDING and their hand total is greater than that of the dealer, the player gains one point from the dealer.</li>
          <li>else, if the player is STANDING and their hand total is the same as that of the dealer it is a dealer, then it is a draw and
            no points are exchanged.</li>
          <li>else - meaning that the player's total is less than that of the dealer, then the dealer gains one point from the player.</li>
        </ul> 
      </li>
      <li>The updated points for the dealer and players are now shown, and you are given the option to play another round.</li>
      <li>This program works with an 'infinite deck' of cards: the chance of withdrawing a specific card - such as the 7 of clubs -
        is the same every time you draw a card, which means that there is a small chance that the same card can appear on
        screen more than once. (The same is true in most casinos, since they use multiple packs of cards in one deck,
        and some even use machines that shuffle the whole deck continuously - which is like an infinite pack.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <question>After playing 10 rounds, how many points did you, and the dealer, end up with?</question>
    <p>Finish playing the game - either by pressing the <b>n</b> key at the end of the round, or by clicking the <b>stop</b>
      button at any point while the program is running.</p>

   VIDEO ALREADY RECORDED

   <question>List several different examples of compound instructions</question>
   <question>When a compound instruction is selected you see its 'extend' [explain] visually.  Indentation. But even if there was no indentation or coloured highlight how else could you determine extent?</question>
   <question>Can you select the header?</question>
</step>

<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: introducing fields</h1>

  <p>Watch the next video:</p>
  <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 65.37530266343825%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f795d314f64c41d68567061b6bd03923" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

  <p>Your task:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Go to instruction number 3:
      <codeblock>call game.addPlayer(new HumanPlayer("Player A", 1000))</codeblock>
      Here, the code is creating a <code>new</code> <code>HumanPlayer</code>, giving it the name <code>"Player A"</code> and <code>1000</code> 
      starting points. This is then added into the <code>game</code> using the method <el-method>addPlayer</el-method>.
    <li>Select (highlight) the <i>second</i> field in that instruction - which is everything within the outer set of brackets. </li>
    <li>Using the cursor keys, backspace, and/or delete - as on most text editors - change <code>"Player A"</code> to 
    your own first name, <i>being careful that you keep the existing double-quote marks at either end of the name.</i></li>
    <li>Run the game again and confirm that your name now appears in place of <b>Player A</b> on the game. 
      Then <b>stop</b> the program and return focus to the editor.</li>
    <li>Select the <i>first</i> field in the same instruction - and delete any one character from <el-method>addPlayer</el-method>. 
    After a couple of seconds you will see a message appear within the code 
    <question>What does the message say?</question>
    <question>As well as the message within the code, something else changed on the screen when you made that edit. What?</question>
    <li>Before completing this step, restore the edited field to its previous contents. You can do this by hand, or you
      can click the <b>Undo</b> button at the top of the screen, or you can press <b>Ctrl-z</b> on the keyboard - the standard key combination for 'undo'.
    </li>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>


  </p>
</step>


<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: adding and removing instructions</h1>
  Input your name and use that instead of literal
  Add a second and third player
</step>

<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: moving instructions</h1>
 move directly - only up or down
 cut and paste

</step>

Enter your name literally. Then via an input & named value.


<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: different kinds of errors</h1>
  Start by referring to 'compile errors'

Code is succinct and pedantic. Different kinds of errors that might result from a change:

- Parse
- compile
- test
- runtime errors?
- logic errors
</step>
