    <question>Having run the program 3-4 times, which of the two players is operating the very 'high risk' strategy, and which the very 'cautious' strategy?</question>

    <question>Having run the program to play 10 rounds automatically, how many points did the Dealer, and each of the players ended up with?</question>
    <question>Run the program a second time, and record how many points ended up with this time</question>
</step>
<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: speeding up the program</h1>
    TODO: check video - should refer to FIVE occurrences of display within procedure
    Watch the next video:
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 78.83211678832116%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/432d4c0974f24685a85b66cf7e2c822e" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    Make sure that you have ghosted the <code>pause</code> (instruction 31) and the <i>five</i> occurrences of <code>call display(game)</code> within
    the <el-method>playOneRound</el-method> procedure, and run the program. You will see that both of the two players have lost points -
    only the Dealer is ahead.
    <question>Which of the two players has lost the least points?</question>
    <question>Given that the result is from playing 100 rounds, and each participant started with 1000 points, calculate the <i>average</i> points lost or gained <i>per round</i> expressed as a percentage,
    for the Dealer and each Player (where a loss is a negative percentage and a gain is positive). <i>Show how you worked this out</i>.</question>

    <question>How many points did the Dealer, and each Player end up with?</question>
    <question>Given that Player B is mimicking the strategy of the Dealer,
        why are they still losing points to the Dealer? (If you can't see why, say so.)
