    <question>Having run the program 3-4 times, which of the two players is operating the very 'high risk' strategy, and which the very 'cautious' strategy?</question>
</step>

<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: identifying the better of the strategies</h1>

    <question>Having run the program to play 10 rounds automatically, how many points did the Dealer, and each of the players ended up with?</question>
    <question>Run the program a second time, and record how many points ended up with this time</question>
</step>
<step><h1>Step STEPNUMBER: speeding up the program</h1>

    Make sure that you have ghosted the <code>pause</code> (instruction 31) and all <i>five</i> occurrences of <code>call display(game)</code> within
    the <el-method>playOneRound</el-method> procedure. Then run the program. You will see that both of the two players have lost points -
    only the Dealer is ahead.
    <question>Which of the two players has lost the least points?</question>
    <question>Given that the result is from playing 100 rounds, and each participant started with 1000 points, calculate the <i>average</i> points lost or gained <i>per round</i> expressed as a percentage,
    for the Dealer and each Player (where a loss is a negative percentage and a gain is positive). <i>Show how you worked this out</i>.</question>

    <question>After making the changes such that the display now only updated after the last round, approximately how long did it take to run 10,000 rounds of Blackjack?</question>
    <question>How many points did the Dealer, and each Player end up with?</question>
    <question>Given that Player B is mimicking the strategy of the Dealer,
        why are they still losing points to the Dealer? (If you can't see why, say so.)

    Answers to the questions in the previous step:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Q: What does defining a named value as a 'variable' allow you to then do?</b> 
            A: It allows you to change the value subsequently.
        </li>
        <li><b>When defining a variable, what two things must you specify?</b>
            You must specify the <i>name</i> for the variable and its initial value.
        </li>
        <li><b>What kind of instruction is used to change the value of a variable?</b>
        A: a <code>set</code> instruction.</li>
        <li><b>Q: What must the code written into the 'condition' field of an 'if' instruction evaluate to?</b>
        A: It must evaluate to 'true' or 'false'</li>
        <li><b>Q: Some types offer 'properties'. What is a property?</b>
        A: a piece of information</li>
        <li><b>Q: If you have a named value and you want to see what properties (if any) you can
            access from it, how do you do that?</b>
        A: by typing a dot after the named value and selecting an option from the pop-up list</li>
        <li><b>Q: What happens if you try to compare two values that are of different types?</b>
        A: You get a 'type incompatibility' error (like comparing apples and oranges)</li>
        <li><b>Q: If you combine more than one operator within a condition, what must you be careful about?</b>
        A: operator precedence</li>
        <li><b>Q: And what is the best way to ensure that you don't run into a problem when combining operators?</b>
        A: by using brackets to ensure that there is no ambiguity between which argument is applied to which operator.</li>
