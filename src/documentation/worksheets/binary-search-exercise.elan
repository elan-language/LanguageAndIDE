# Exercise: implement a function to search for an item in a sorted list, 
# using the 'binary search' algorithm
# The code below defines the signature for the 'binarySearch' function,
# with just enough code to compile, but it fails multiple tests.
# Your task is to implement binarySearch sufficient to get all the tests passing.
# You can then run the main program, which applies the function.
# 
# Hints:
# - Use a recursive implementation, but as with any recursive function think first
#   about the 'termination' condition
# - Find the mid-point of ths list using integer division ('div')
# - To compare strings alphabetically use the .isBefore or .isAfter dot-methods 
# - To extract the lists before and after the mid-point use the range indexes:
#    'li[..mid]' and 'li[mid+1..]'
# - You can implement the whole algorithm just by adding a new 'if' statement between the
#   first and last lines, containing 'else if/else' clauses as needed. Each clause should
#   set the result.
# - Use 'let' statements to calculate any sub-expression that will be used more than once
#   in your logic and/or to improve readability.
