<h1>Blackjack 1</h1>
Is designed to be your first exposure to programming. 
First, the pupil runs the Blackjack program, to understand how the game works.
Then they learn: how to navigate around the code that defines up the program,
the nature of instructions, and how to recognise the different kinds of instruction.
Finally, they are shown how to make some very small changes to the code, which can
result in a significant enhancement to the game, once run.

<h1>Blackjack 2</h1>
This is designed to introduce the idea of writing new instructions including:
<ul>
  <li>the nature and purpose of a function</li>
  <li>the nature and purpose of variables and how to define one</li>
  <li>how to change ('set') the value held by a variable</li>
  <li>the nature and purpose of a conditional instruction ('if')</li>
  <li>how to access 'properties' of a value (if any) using 'dot syntax'</li>
</ul>
All this is done by improving a <i>slightly</i> different version of the Blackjack program
that has automated players. To start with the two automated players, have very different strategies
- though neither is very effective. Over multiple iterations the pupil gets to modify
these strategies and improve them progressively - repeatedly 'leap-frogging' the poorer performing
player over the better one.

<h1>Whack-a-mole</h1>
Create a simple version of the game Whack-a-mole, learning about the nature and application of Arrays.
