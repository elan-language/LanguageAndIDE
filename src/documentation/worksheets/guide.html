<p>The standard worksheets listed below are listed in the recommended order in which they should be undertaken.</p>

<h3>Exploring and editing code</h3>

<p> UNDER DEVELOPMENT</p>

<!-- <p>The Elan IDE has a powerful 'code editor' which greatly simplifies the tasks of browsing, editing, and entering code.
  This worksheet is a good start point if you have never used Elan. You will explore and edit an existing program.
</p>

<p>No prior knowledge is presumed.</p>

<p>What you will do in the course of completing the worksheet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load, Run, and Stop a program</li>
  <li>Ensure that the Code Editor has focus in order to browse or change the code.</li>
  <li>Learn that a program consists of instructions: simple instructions (single line) and compound instructions, which contain other instructions</li>
  <li>Identify different parts of an instruction including a <el-kw>keyword</el-kw>, <el-id>name</el-id>, <el-method>method</el-method> and more.</li>
  <li>How to move the 'focus' around the code, using the mouse, or keyboard</li>
  <li>How to delete an instruction, or a selection of instructions</li>
  <li>How to move one or more instructions up/down, or cut and paste them elsewhere</li>
  <li>How to recognise when an action has damaged the code, and how to restore the changes using Undo</li>
  <li>Understand that an instruction has editable parts ('fields') and non-editable parts, and how to edit the former.</li>
  <li>How to insert new instructions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Random walk</h3>
<p>Intended as a possible <i>very first</i> exercise in programming - you create a simulation
of a random walk, which significant applications in many different fields of study: 
physics, biology, ecology, economics ..., even computer science.</p>

<p>Prior knowledge required: you do not need any prior knowledge of how to program, nor of the Elan <i>language</i>.
  You do need to understand how to use the code editor.</p>
<p>What you will do in the course of completing the worksheet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to create a new program and ensure that what you create is auto-saved.</li>
  <li>Use <el-Type>Turtle</el-Type> graphics</li>
  <li>Call a ready-made procedure</li>
  <li>Use a <el-kw>for</el-kw>loop and <el-cw>while</el-cw> loop, and understand the difference between them</li>
  <li>Create random numbers</li>
  <li>Define a named value with a <el-kw>let</el-kw> and with a <el-kw>variable</el-kw> instruction and when to use which.</li>
  <li>Define and use mathematical expressions in code</li>
  <li><el-kw>print</el-kw> a message on the display, including calculated results.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Whack-a-mole</h3>

<p>By creating a very simple version of the game 'Whack-a-mole' you will learn how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use an Array to hold related data items.</li>
  <li>Read or modify a specific-numbered element within an array.</li>
  <li>Use an <el-kw>each</el-kw> to do something to, or with, each element in an array.</li>
  <li>Make use of the system's 'clock' to manage timing of events</li>
  <li>Identify and make use of a key pressed by the player when the program is running.</li>
  <li>Use more sophisticated alternatives to the <el-kw>print</el-kw> keyword, giving you more control.</li>
</ul>
