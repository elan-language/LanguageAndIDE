    <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are not familiar with Wordle puzzles, then before proceding, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle" target-="_blank">visit the official online
        Wordle site</a>, read the instructions and try to solve today's puzzle.</li>
      <li>Set the browser to Full Screen view, to give this worksheet, and your code, as much space as possible.</li>
      <li>Remember that if the code editor has a tinted background it does not have focus and will not respond
          to edits. To give it focus click within the editor. (If a program is running, you will need to stop it first.)</li>
      <li>Use the auto-completion options as much as possible, because this reduces errors.</li>
      <li>Use the <i>Hints</i> only when you <i>need</i> them - as all use of hints is recorded. Use of <b>Help</b> is encouraged and not recorded.</li>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Select <b>File > Load</b> and locate the file <b>wordle-start.elan</b>.
        Select <b>File > Auto Save</b> and save the file to your personal file system. This will ensure that the changes
        you will be making to your version of the <i>code</i> are always saved. 
      </li>
      <li>Run the game and the <b>Display</b> will show a re-creation of the Wordle screen. Try entering your first
        and second guess words.  You will notice that any word you enter receives the identical response - and 
        as you enter more words those identical responses will sooner or later become inconsistent with each other.
      </li>
      <li>Stop the program and explore the code. Look first at frame number XX - the function named <code>markAttempt</code>.
      A comment in the code explains that this is a 'stub' - a minimal implementation that lets the program compile and
      run, but which is known not to be correct. Your first task is to make the Wordle game work by writing a proper
      implementation of this function.</li>
      <li>Immediately below this function you will find a <code>test</code>, which is 'ghosted' 
        (indicated by the <code># [ghosted]</code> 'compiler directive, and by the pale tint') so that it is currently ignored by the compiler).
      Select the <code>test</code>, then from the 'context menu' (brought up on a selected instruction by <b>right-mouse-click</b>,
    or by pressing <b>Ctrl-m</b>) and selecting <b>unghost</b>.</li>
    <li>The <b>Test</b> status will now indicate that all of the <code>assert</code> instructions are failing.</li>
    <li>Examine these individual assert statements noting each time <code>markAttempt</code> is called, the first argument
    is the attempt (guess) and the second is the target (the word that has been set as the answer. The function should
    return a string of five characters, each of which must be <code>0</code>to represent 'no match' (grey), 
    <code>1</code>, to represent an 'out of place' match (yellow), or <code>2</code> to represent an 'in-place' match (green).
    These three numeric digits are translated into the colours to be rendered on the Display by the <code>style</code> sheet, 
    which may be found in frame number xx.
