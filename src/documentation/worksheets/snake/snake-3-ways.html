    <ul>
      <li>Set the browser to Full Screen view, to give this worksheet, and your code, as much space as possible.</li>
      <li>Remember that if the code editor has a tinted background it does not have focus and will not respond
          to edits. To give it focus click within the editor. (If a program is running, you will need to stop it first.)

    <h3>Snake - procedural</h3>

      From the <b>Demo</b> menu, access the <b>Snake - procedural</b> program, and run it (<i>briefly!</i>) to see how it works.
      Explore the code to answer the following questions. You <i>might</i> find it helpful to switch the code to 'outline'
        view (using the <b>outline</b> button) to answer some of them.
    <ol>
      <li>How many instructions does the program have, not counting the tests (which are all at the end of the program)?
        <textarea class="question" id="1a"></textarea>
      </li>
      <li>What is the longest method (<el-kw>main</el-kw>,<el-kw>procedure</el-kw>, or <el-kw>function</el-kw>) - measured by number of instructions (including the method signature)?
        <textarea class="question" id="1b"></textarea>
      </li>
      <li>What is the deepest level of indentation within any method - where the <i>first</i> instruction within the method is deemed to be 'level 0'?
        <textarea class="question" id="1c"></textarea>
      </li>
      <li>What is the largest number of parameters passed into any one <el-kw>procedure</el-kw> or <el-kw>function</el-kw>)?
        <textarea class="question" id="1d"></textarea>
      </li>
      <li>What percentage of the instructions (not counting code in tests) is <i>covered</i> by tests? You can assume that:
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>only</i> code being covered by tests is in functions</li>
          <li>Where a test tests a specific function, assume that all paths through that function are tested</li>
        </ul>
        So this question is really just asking: what proportion of the <i>program's</i> instructions is represented by the functions
        that have a corresponding test?
        <textarea class="question" id="1e"></textarea>
      </li>
      <li>What, if anything, stands out for you about this code - positively and/or negatively?
        <textarea class="question" id="1f"></textarea>
      </li>

    <h3>Snake - object-oriented</h3>

   From the <b>Demo</b> menu, access the <b>Snake - object-oriented</b> program.
   Verify - if you wish to - that from the player's perspective it works identically to the previous implementation.
   Explore the code to answer the following questions.
   You <i>might</i> find it helpful to switch the code to 'outline' view (using the <b>outline</b> button) to answer some of them.

      <li>Not counting any code within tests, what <i>percentage</i> of the total <i>program</i> instructions is defined in classes (include
        the <el-kw>class</el-kw> instructions)?
        <textarea class="question" id="2c"></textarea></li>
        <li>Which of the user-defined <i>classes</i> define any <el-kw>private</el-kw> members?
           <textarea class="question" id="2d"></textarea></li>
      <li>Which of the user-defined <i>classes</i> are 'singletons' - meaning that they are only ever instantiated once during
        <i>a program run</i> (ignore instantiation in tests)?
        <textarea class="question" id="2e"></textarea></li>
      <li>What is the longest method (<el-kw>main</el-kw>,<el-kw>procedure</el-kw>, or <el-kw>function</el-kw>)
        - measured by number of instructions (including the method signature)?
        <textarea class="question" id="2f"></textarea></li>
      <li>What is the deepest level of indentation within any method - where the first instruction <i>within</i> the method is deemed to be 'level 0'?
        <textarea class="question" id="2g"></textarea></li>
      <li>What is the largest number of parameters passed into any one <el-kw>procedure</el-kw> or <el-kw>function</el-kw>)?
        <textarea class="question" id="2h"></textarea></li>
      <li>Which <el-kw>function</el-kw> methods, on which classes, are not tested (see comments in the tests)

      <li>Why, in general terms, are there not tests for some function methods? (Look for comments)
