    <h1>Step 1: introduction</h1>
    <p>Following-on from 'Wordle 2: writing an automated solver', in this worksheet your challenge
      is to write an analyser that can evaluate:
      </p><ol>
        <li>Just how effective that automated solver is at solving puzzles, 
          by getting it attempt to solve all 2,315 of the possible target words, and measuring
          the percentage that it solves within six attempts. For those successful cases,
          it should also calculate the average number of attempts required.
        </li>
        <li>Whether <b>ARISE</b> is the best starting word for that algorithm or, if not, 
          what is the best starting word.</li>
      </ol>
    <p></p>

    <p><button class="load" id="load1-0">Load the starting code</button></p><div hidden=""></div> and note the following:
      <p></p><ul>
        <li>Underneath all the <el-code><el-kw>import</el-kw></el-code>s you will see all the code you have written
        in the previous projects, plus some new code that you will be using and/or modifying in this worksheet.</li>
        <li>The new code currently has no <el-code><el-kw>main</el-kw></el-code> routine - but you will be adding one.</li>
        <li>There are two ghosted tests at the bottom, each covering several test cases
          and referring to functions that do not yet exist, but you will be writing.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
<label class="done" for="done1">Step Completed</label><input class="step-complete" type="checkbox" id="done1"><span> Total hints used: <span class="hints-taken"></span>/<span class="hints-total"></span></span></div>

<div class="step" id="step2">
  <h1>Step 2: start developing 'attemptsNeededToSolve'</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Unghost the test named <el-comment>attemptsNeededToSolve</el-comment>. This will
      cause the tests to run, but they will all fail, and it is easy to see why because
      the function <el-method>attemptsNeededToSolve</el-method> immediately above the
      test is just a 'stub' - the minimum code needed to compile.</li>
    <li>A proper implementation for <el-method>attemptsNeededToSolve</el-method> will
      re-use quite a bit of the logic from <el-method>attemptsNeededToSolve</el-method>
      but with these differences:
      <ul>
        <li><el-method>attemptsNeededToSolve</el-method> is a <i>function</i> so it will not
          do any Input/Output - so none of the <el-code><el-kw>call</el-kw></el-code> instructions will be copied.</li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
