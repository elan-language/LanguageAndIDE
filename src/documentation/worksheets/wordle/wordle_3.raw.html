<title>Wordle 3: analysing the effectiveness of the solver</title>
<step>
    <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: introduction</h1>
    <p>Following-on from 'Wordle 2: writing an automated solver', in this worksheet your challenge
      is to write an analyser that can evaluate:
      <ol>
        <li>Just how effective the automated solver is at solving puzzles. This will be
          done by getting it attempt to solve all 2,315 of the possible target words, and measuring
          the percentage that it solves within six attempts and, for those successful cases,
          the average number of attempts required.
        </li>
        <li>Whether <b>ARISE</b> is the best starting word or, if not, what is the best
        starting word.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p><load file="">Load the starting code</load> and note the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Underneath all the <code>import</code>s you will see all the code you have written
        in the previous projects.</li>
        <li>The new code currently has no <code>main</code> routine - but you will be adding one.</li>
        <li>There are two ghosted tests at the bottom, each covering several test cases
          and referring to functions that do not yet exist, but you will be writing.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
