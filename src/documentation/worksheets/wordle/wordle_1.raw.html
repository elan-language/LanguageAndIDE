    <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: Introduction</h1>
    <p>We are going to create a working implementation of the Wordle puzzle.
        If you have never previously solved a Wordle puzzle, you should visit the 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">official Wordle site</a>
        and solve today's puzzle, so you know how it works.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click this button:  <button class="load" value="documentation/worksheets/wordle/wordle_1begin.elan">Load</button>
          to load the starting code into the code editor, and then run the program.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Display</b> you will see 
        a facsimile of the puzzle, and if you enter your first guess
        (five letters - using <b>Backspace</b> if you make a mistake - then <b>Enter</b>) each
        letter will be marked green, yellow, or grey. But if you continue with further guesses
        you will quickly discover that it marks <i>every</i> guess word with the same result!
        Though this program has correctly implemented the <i>presentation</i>, and the
        <i>user interactions</i>, of the official puzzle, 
        it hasn't implemented the core logic of how guesses are marked.</li>
        <li>Stop the program</li>
        <li>In the code, look at instruction number 12 - the <el-method>markAttempt</el-method>
        function. Comments within the function boydy state that the current implementation is just a 'stub' - the minimum code needed
        to allow the program to compile and run. It returns
        a five-character string, as expected: <code>2</code> for an 'in-place' match (green), 
        <code>1</code> for an 'out-of-place' match (yellow), or <code>0</code> for no match (grey). But
        it always returns the same mark, paying no attention to the two parameters: the 
        <code>attempt</code> word (your guess) and the <code>target</code> word 
        (selected by the computer but hidden from the user).</li>
        <li>Immediately following the <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function you will see a <code>test</code>
            which has been 'ghosted'. Select the test and <b>unghost</b> (via the context menu: <b>Ctrl-m</b> or right-mouse-click).
             The tests will automatically run a couple of seconds later.
        <question>How many of the <code>assert</code> instructions within the test have failed?</question>
        </li>
        <li>In the <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function, change the 'default' value to which the <code>mark</code> string is set, so that it returns a string of five zeroes.</li>
        <question>Which, if any, of the <code>assert</code> instructions within the tests now pass?</question>
        </ul>
</step>

<step>
  <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: Mark 'green' matches correctly</h1>
    If you were telling a person  how to mark an attempt word against a target word <i>manually</i>,
    you would probably tell them to look for any 'green' matches first. (It's far more complicated to
    try to do it any other way.) In the <code>test</code> you can see that the first few (failing) <code>assert</code>s are
    all testing just for green matches. So, your first task is to modify the 
    <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function, such that the four 'Only greens' tests pass.
    Here are some initial ideas that will help:
    <ul>
      <li>The function will need to set individual characters within the five-character <code>mark</code> string.</li>
      <li>You can access an individual character within a string by 'indexing'. Indexes start from 0. 
        For example, you can access just the first character of a string held by the named value <el-id>a</el-id> with
        <code>a[0]</code>.</li>
      <li>Given that you need to check each of the five character positions in turn, this suggests a loop.
        Think about which <i>kind</i> of loop is most suitable.</li>
      <li>Within the loop you will need a condition for testing whether there is a 'green' match between the character in the attempt word
        and the target word.</li>
      <li>When there is a match you will need to change the <code>mark</code> (for just that character position) from a
        <el-lit>0</el-lit> to a <el-lit>2</el-lit>. This is the trickiest part of this step, because 
        <code>String</code> is an 'immutable' type in Elan (as it is in most programming languages): 
        so you can't change its contents <i>directly</i>. Instead,
        you must build a new string out of parts of the original with necessary changes incorporated.</li>
      <li>  
        Use 'index ranges' to help build this new string from parts of the original.
        If you are not familiar with 'index ranges': look them up in <b>Library Reference - Value Types - String</b> within the <b>Help</b> tab </li>
    </ul>
  <hint>Hint HINTNUMBER More detail</hint>
  <content>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a <el-kw>for</el-kw> loop. The <i>suggested</i> name for the counter is 
        <el-id>i</el-id> (short for 'index'). You don't <i>have</i> to use
        this name, but this name is assumed in further hints. 
        Remember that the 'counter' variable needs to start from zero, when used
        for indexing. Think: what value should to count <i>to</i>, in order to include all five character positions in turn?</li>
      <li>Use an <el-kw>if</el-kw> instruction to implement the condition. Remember that to test if two values
        are the same you use the <el-kw>is</el-kw> keyword (separated from the values by a space). You will be comparing
        the same indexed value from the <el-id>attempt</el-id> and <el-id>target</el-id> strings.</li>
      <li>Build the string to be returned from three parts: the existing string up to (but not including) the character to be changed;
        the new character; a copy of the original string <i>following</i> the character being changed.
        Carefully check your ideas against the rules for index ranges in the documentation (<b>help</b> tab).</li>
    </ul>

  </content>
  <hint>Hint HINTNUMBER The instruction to modify the mark</hint>
  <content>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a <el-kw>set</el-kw> instruction to replace the existing value of <el-id>mark</el-id> with a new one.</li>
      <li>The expression for the right hand side of the <el-kw>set</el-kw> instruction looks like this:<br>
      <code>mark[something] + "2" + mark[something]</code><br>
      where you need to replace 'something' with a range - different for the two cases. The first range will be for
      the characters <i>up to but not including</i> the current index, the second range will be from the
      character <i>after</i> the current index, onwards.
      </li>
      <li>When you are writing a tricky expression like this, it can be very helpful to write your own test
        <i>just for that expression</i>. Add this code below the function:
        <codeblock>
          test ranges
            let mark be "00000"
            let i be 3
            let expression be mark[something] + "2" + mark[something]
            assert expression is "00020"
          end test
        </codeblock>
        again replacing <el-id>something</el-id> with the ranges, until you have the tests passing.
        (Remember that tests will run only if all <i>other</i> code is parsing <i>and</i> compiling - if necessary
        temporarily delete any incomplete instructions until you have this test passing.)

    <ul>
        <li>Now we will tackle the yellows. Underneath the <code>for</code> loop that you just created,
        create a <i>second</i> loop using the same values. (It might be tempting to try to process the greens and yellows
        within the same loop, but you would find that to be <i>much</i> more difficult in the end.) 
        The new loop can use the same name for the counter, because the previous loop will already have finished using it.</li>
        <li>Within the new loop add an <code>if</code> instruction as before, but for our first stab at this,
        use the condition that the <code>target</code> word <i>contains</i> the character of interest.</li>
        <li>If it does then set the corresponding character in <code>mark</code> using the same expression as in the
        previous ('greens') loop, but setting the character to <el-lit>1</el-lit> instead of <el-lit>2</el-lit>.</li>
        <li>This first stab should get <i>most</i> (but not all) of the 'Yellow only' cases passing.
        However, it will also have caused an unwanted consequence, which we will ask you to describe at the end of this step

  <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: mark the 'yellows' without over-writing 'greens'.</h1>
        <p>The problem is: letters that were marked green in the first loop, are being 'overwritten'
            by a yellow. In the second loop we need to exlude any characters that have already been 
            marked green. Attempt it now by modifying the <code>if</code> condition within in the second loop. You should
            get all the 'Green only' cases passing again, and <i>all except one</i> of the 'Yellow only' cases.</p>

<step>
  <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: factor-out common code into a separate function</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>First, the answers to two questions at the end of the previous step: 
      <ul>
          <li>The brackets are needed around <code>(mark[n] isnt "2")</code>
          to specify the priority between the <code>isnt</code> and the <code>and</code> operators. Without
          them the <code>and</code> is applied to the <code>"2"</code> and <code>target.contains(attempt[n])</code>,
          which are not compatible.)</li>
          <li>One of the 'Only yellows' <code>assert</code>s is still failing because the <i>both</i>
          the Xs in the attempt word are being marked yellow even though there is only one X in the target word.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Now, before moving on to dealing with the one remaining failure of the 'Only yellows' test cases, we
      have what professional developers call a 'technical debt' issue. The two expressions that are used to 
    update the mark are very similar - too similar:
    <codeblock>
      set mark to mark[..i] + "2" + mark[i + 1..]
    </codeblock> 
    <codeblock>
      set mark to mark[..i] + "1" + mark[i + 1..]
    </codeblock> 
    Applying the 'DRY' principle (<b>D</b>on't <b>R</b>epeat <b>Y</b>ourself) we should extract this common
    code into a separate function. The two expressions aren't <i>identical</i> so we need to 'parameterise' 
    the expression - passing in just the part that differs as a parameter into the function.
    </li>
    <li>So, create a new function named <el-method>setChar</el-method> that will set a specified character
      number, on a specified string, to a new specified character. As before, it won't actually
      modify the original string: it will return a new string, built from the original but with the specified difference.
    It should specify three parameters in the following order, using these names:
    <ul>
      <li><el-id>str</el-id>The string that you need to update</li>
      <li><el-id>n</el-id> the character number (counting from zero) that you want to change</li>
      <li><el-id>ch</el-id> the new character (a single character string) to put in place of the existing character.</li>
    </ul>

  Start by creating just the function 'signature' - defining the name, parameters, and return type.
  In the body of the function, initially just return an empty string <code>""</code> so that the function compiles.
   <hint>Hint HINTNUMBER: The complete function signature</hint>
   <content>
    <code>
      function setChar(str as String, n as Int, ch as String) returns String
        return ""
      end function
    </code>
  </content>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now write some tests for the function - expecting that they will initially fail because we haven't written the function yet.
    Create a <el-kw>test</el-kw> with the name 'setChar' and add asserts for each of these cases:
    <ul>
      <li><code>setChar("00000", 0, "1")</code> should return <code>"10000"</code></li>
      <li><code>setChar("00000", 1, "1")</code> should return <code>"01000"</code></li>
      <li><code>setChar("00000", 2, "1")</code> should return <code>"00100"</code></li>
      <li><code>setChar("00000", 3, "2")</code> should return <code>"00020"</code></li>
      <li><code>setChar("00000", 4, "2")</code> should return <code>"00002"</code></li>
    </ul>
    <hint>Hint HINTNUMBER: The complete test</hint>
    <content>
     <codeblock>
      test setChar
        assert setChar("00000", 0, "1") is "10000"
        assert setChar("00000", 1, "1") is "01000"
        assert setChar("00000", 2, "1") is "00100"
        assert setChar("00000", 3, "2") is "00020"
        assert setChar("00000", 4, "2") is "00002"
      end test
     </codeblock>
   </content>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now replace the 'stub' implementation of <el-method>setChar</el-method> function (returning an empty string) with a modified version of the two
    expressions for modifying <el-id>mark</el-id> within the <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function,
    making use of all three parameters defined in the <el-method>setChar</el-method> signature.

<h1>Step STEPNUMBER</h1>
  <ul>
     <li>There is one 'Only yellows' test that is still failing - because the three <b>P</b>s in the attempt word
       are all being matched against the single 'P' in the target word. 
       We need to keep a tally of which letters in the <code>target</code> word have already been 'used' - for green, and for yellow.
        The easiest way to do this would be to blank out a character in the <code>target</code> word as it is used. However
        <code>target</code> is a parameter, and Elan (deliberately) does not allow you to <code>set</code> a parameter within
        in a function. So, instead, at the top of the function, just below the existing definition of <code>mark</code>,
        define another variable named 'unused' and initialise it to the value of <code>target</code> - because at the <i>start</i>
        of the function none of the letters has been used. 
     </li>
     <li>
        Find the <i>two</i> places where <code>target</code> is currently referenced <i>within</i> the

         instead.
     </li>
     <li>
      Within the <i>first</i> loop, underneath the instruction that
        sets the <code>mark</code>, add a new instruction to set the same character number in <code>unused</code> to a single

     <question>Has it fixed any other failing tests?</question>
  </step>

  <h1>Step STEPNUMBER Get all remaining tests passing</h1>
  To fix the final failing tests we need to ensure that the <i>second</i> loop - managing the yellows matches - 
  <i>also</i> does not use a letter from the target word more than once. Within this loop, 
  underneath the instruction that sets the <el-id>mark</el-id>, add a new instruction
  that updates the <el-id>mark</el-id>. Note, however, that this instruction will be
  different to the one you just wrote within the <i>first</i> loop. See if you can figure it out.
  <hint>Hint HINTNUMBER Key ideas</hint>
  <content>
    <ul>
      <li>You will need to identify the character <i>number</i> of the matched letter within <el-id>unused</el-id>.</li>
      <li>A string variable has a 'dot method' named <el-method>indexOf</el-method> that will help.</li>
    </ul>

  </content>
  <hint>Hint HINTNUMBER A useful expression</hint>
  <content>
    The expression <code>unused.indexOf(attempt[n])</code> will calculate the character <i>number</i> (starting 0) for
    the character <code>attempt[n]</code> within <code>unused</code>.

  <hint>Hint HINTNUMBER The complete <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function </hint>
  <content>
    <codeblock>
      function markAttempt(attempt as String, target as String) returns String
        variable mark set to "00000"
        variable unused set to target
        for n from 0 to 4 step 1
          if attempt[n] is unused[n] then
            set mark to setChar(mark, n, "2")
            set unused to setChar(unused, n, " ")
          end if
        end for
        for n from 0 to 4 step 1
          if (mark[n] isnt "2") and unused.contains(attempt[n]) then
            set mark to setChar(mark, n, "1")
            set unused to setChar(unused, unused.indexOf(attempt[n]), " ")
          end if
        end for
        return mark

    <h3>Mission accomplished</h3>
    <p>Assuming that you have all the tests for <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> passing, you should be
    able to run the program and solve the Wordle puzzle. The computer will pick a different word
    each time you run the program.</p>
    <h3>Optional refinements</h3>
    If you have time, consider making small improvements to the game, for example.
    <ul>
        <li>Create a loop within <code>main</code> to solve a fixed number of puzzles in succession,
        and then allow the user to specify, at the start, how many puzzles.</li>
        <li>Keep track of how many of those puzzles the user solved within six attempts, and how many were unsolved.
            Print this at the end of the run e.g. 'You solved 7 out of 10 puzzles within six attempts'.
        </li>
        <li>For the puzzles successfully solved, keep track of the number of attempts taken and, at the end of the
            run of puzzle, calculate the average number of attempts, displayed to, say, 2 decimal places.
        </li>
        <li>Make it a two player game, where each player must solve the same number of puzzles (with the target
            words being different for each) and then the scores are compared at the end.
        </li>
    </ul>
