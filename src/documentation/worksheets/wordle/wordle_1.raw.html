<title>Wordle 1: implementing the Wordle puzzle logic</title>
<step>
    <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: introduction</h1>
    <p>We are going to create a working implementation of the Wordle puzzle.
        If you have never previously solved a Wordle puzzle, you should visit the 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">official Wordle site</a>
        and solve today's puzzle, so you know how it works.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><load file="wordle_1begin.elan">Load the starting code</load> and then immediately <b>run</b> the program.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Display</b> you will see 
        a facsimile of the puzzle, and if you enter your first guess
        (five letters - using <b>Backspace</b> if you make a mistake - then <b>Enter</b>) each
        letter will be marked green, yellow, or grey. But if you continue with further guesses
        you will quickly discover that it marks <i>every</i> guess word with the same result!
        Though this program has correctly implemented the <i>presentation</i>, and the
        <i>user interactions</i>, of the official puzzle, 
        it hasn't implemented the core logic of how guesses are marked.</li>
        <li><b>stop</b> the program</li>
        <li>In the code, look at instruction number 12 - the <el-method>markAttempt</el-method>
        function. Comments within the function body state that the current implementation is just a 'stub' - the minimum code needed
        to allow the program to compile and run. It returns
        a five-character string, as expected: <code>2</code> for an 'in-place' match (green), 
        <code>1</code> for an 'out-of-place' match (yellow), or <code>0</code> for no match (grey). But
        it always returns the same mark, paying no attention to the 
        <code>attempt</code> word (your guess) or the <code>target</code> word 
        (selected by the computer but hidden from the user).</li>
        <li>Immediately following the <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function you will see a <code>test</code>
            which has been 'ghosted'. Select the test and <b>unghost</b> (via the context menu).
             The tests will automatically run a couple of seconds later.
        <question>How many of the <code>assert</code> instructions within the test have failed?</question>
        </li>
        <li>In the <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function, change the 'default' value to which the <code>mark</code> string is set, so that it returns a string of five zeroes.</li>
        <question>Which, if any, of the <code>assert</code> instructions within the tests now pass?</question>
        </ul>
</step>

<step>
  <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: mark 'green' matches correctly</h1>
    If you were telling a person  how to mark an attempt word against a target word <i>manually</i>,
    you would probably tell them to look for any 'green' matches first. (It's far more complicated to
    try to do it any other way.) In the <code>test</code> you can see that the first few failing test cases 
    (each <code>assert</code> instruction is one test case) are
    all testing just for just green matches. So, your first task is to modify the 
    <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function such that the three 'Only greens' tests pass.
    Here are some initial ideas that will help:
    <ul>
      <li>The function will need to set individual characters within the five-character <code>mark</code> string.</li>
      <li>You can access an individual character within a string by 'indexing'. Indexes start from 0. 
        For example, you can access just the first character of a string held by the named value <el-id>a</el-id> with
        <code>a[0]</code>.</li>
      <li>Given that you need to check each of the five character positions in turn, this suggests a loop.
        Think about which <i>kind</i> of loop is most suitable.</li>
      <li>Within the loop you will need a condition for testing whether there is a 'green' match between the character in the attempt word
        and the target word.</li>
      <li>When there is a match you will need to change the <code>mark</code> (for just that character position) from a
        <el-lit>0</el-lit> to a <el-lit>2</el-lit>. This is the trickiest part of this step, because 
        <code>String</code> is an 'immutable' type in Elan (as it is in most programming languages): 
        so you can't change its contents <i>directly</i>. Instead,
        you must build a new string out of parts of the original with necessary changes incorporated.</li>
      <li>  
        Use 'index ranges' to help build this new string from parts of the original.
        If you are not familiar with 'index ranges': look them up in <b>Library Reference - Value Types - String</b> within the <b>Help</b> tab </li>
    </ul>
  <hint>Hint HINTNUMBER: more detail</hint>
  <content>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a <el-kw>for</el-kw> loop. The <i>suggested</i> name for the counter is 
        <el-id>i</el-id> (short for 'index'). You don't <i>have</i> to use
        this name, but this name is assumed in further hints. 
        Remember that the 'counter' variable needs to start from zero, when used
        for indexing. Think: what value should the loop count <i>to</i>, in order to include all five character positions in turn?</li>
      <li>Use an <el-kw>if</el-kw> instruction to implement the condition. Remember that to test if two values
        are the same you use the <el-kw>is</el-kw> keyword (separated from the values by spaces). You will be comparing
        the same indexed value from the <el-id>attempt</el-id> and <el-id>target</el-id> strings.</li>
      <li>Build the string to be returned from three parts: 
        <ul>
          <li>the existing string up to (but not including) the character to be changed</li>
          <li>the new character</li>
          <li>a copy of the original string <i>following</i> the character being changed.</li>
        </ul>
        Carefully check your ideas against the rules for index ranges in the Elan documentation.</li>

          set something to something

  <hint>Hint HINTNUMBER: the instruction to modify the mark</hint>
  <content>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a <el-kw>set</el-kw> instruction to replace the existing value of <el-id>mark</el-id> with a new one.</li>
      <li>The expression for the right hand side of the <el-kw>set</el-kw> instruction looks like this:<br>
      <code>mark[something] + "2" + mark[something]</code><br>
      Replace each <code>something</code> with appropriate code. The first range will be for
      the characters <i>up to but not including</i> the current index, the second range will be from the
      character <i>after</i> the current index, onwards.
      </li>
      <li>When you are writing a tricky expression like this, it can be very helpful to write your own <code>test</code>
        <i>just for that expression</i>. You are not <i>required</i> to do this, but doing so could help you
        avoid having to take a further hint. Add this code below the function:
        <codeblock>
          test ranges
            let mark be "00000"
            let i be 3
            let result be mark[something] + "2" + mark[something]
            assert result is "00020"
          end test
        </codeblock>
        again replacing <el-id>something</el-id> with the ranges, until you have this test passing.
        (Remember that tests will run only if all <i>other</i> code is parsing <i>and</i> compiling - if necessary
        temporarily delete any <i>incomplete</i> instructions until you have this test passing.)

<step>
  <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: start on the yellow matches</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Underneath the <code>for</code> loop that you just created,
        create a <i>second</i> loop using the same values. (It might be tempting to try to process the greens and yellows
        within the same loop, but you would find that to be <i>much</i> more difficult in the end.) 
        The new loop can use the same name for the counter, because the previous loop will already have finished using it.</li>
        <li>Within the new loop add an <code>if</code> instruction as before, but for our first stab at this,
        use the condition that the <code>target</code> word <i>contains</i> the character of interest.</li>
        <li>If it does then set the corresponding character in <code>mark</code> using the same expression as in the
        previous ('greens') loop, but setting the character to <el-lit>1</el-lit> instead of <el-lit>2</el-lit>.</li>
        <li>This first stab should get <i>most</i> (but not all) of the 'Yellow only' cases passing.
        However, it will also have caused an unwanted consequence, which we will ask you to describe at the end of this step.

  <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: mark the 'yellows' without over-writing 'greens'</h1>
  <p>The problem is: letters that were marked green in the first loop, are being 'overwritten'
      by a yellow. In the second loop we need to exlude any characters that have already been 
      marked green. Attempt it now by modifying the <code>if</code> condition within in the second loop. You should
      get all the 'Green only' cases passing again, and <i>all except one</i> of the 'Yellow only' cases.</p>

  <question>Why is one of the 'Yellow only' cases still failing? (Look at what is different about the that specific case)</question>
  <p>We will address that failing test shortly, but first we are going to do a little bit of 'refactoring' - a hugely
  important practice when writing good code.</p>
 </step>

<step>
  <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: factor-out common code into a separate function</h1>
    <p>Before moving on to dealing with the one remaining failure of the 'Only yellows' test cases, we
      going to deal with what professional developers call a 'code smell'! The two expressions that are used to 
      update the mark are very similar:
      <codeblock>
        set mark to mark[..i] + "2" + mark[i + 1..]
      </codeblock> 
      <codeblock>
        set mark to mark[..i] + "1" + mark[i + 1..]
      </codeblock> 
      Applying the 'DRY' principle (<b>D</b>on't <b>R</b>epeat <b>Y</b>ourself) we should extract this common
      code into a separate function. The two expressions aren't <i>identical</i> so we need to 'parameterise' 
      the expression - passing just the part that differs as a parameter into the function.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a new function named <el-method>setChar</el-method> that will set a specified character
      number, on a specified string, to a new specified character. As before, it won't actually
      modify the original string: it will return a new string, built from the original but with the specified differences.
      The function should define three parameters in the following order, using these names:
      <ul>
        <li><el-id>str</el-id> - the string that you need to update</li>
        <li><el-id>i</el-id> - the character number (counting from zero) that you want to change</li>
        <li><el-id>ch</el-id> - the new character (a <code>String</code> that contains just one character) to put in place of the existing character</li>
      </ul>
      Start by creating the function, defining the name, parameters, and return type.
      In the body of the function, provide a 'stub' implementation - by returning an empty string.</li>
    <li>Find the <i>ghosted</i> <code>test</code> <el-comment>setChar</el-comment> 
    at the bottom of the file, and <b>unghost</b> it (via the context menu). Provided that your 
    signature for the <el-method>setChar</el-method> function correct, your code should <i>compile</i> but
    all the newly-added test cases should fail.</li>
    <li>Your task is to implement <el-method>setChar</el-method> such that these tests all pass, and then
    to replace the two original expressions within <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> with evaluations of
    <el-method>setChar</el-method> provding the correct arguments in each case.

<h1>Step STEPNUMBER: keep track of which letters in the target have been 'used' as greens</h1>
  The green tests are failing because letters that have already marked green are then being marked as yellow matches.
  <ul>
    <li>To fix this we need to keep a tally of which letters in the <code>target</code> word have already been 'used'.
    The easiest way to do this would be to blank out a character in the <code>target</code> word as it is used. However
    <code>target</code> is a parameter, and Elan (deliberately) does not allow you to <code>set</code> a parameter within
    in a function - as this would be a 'side effect', which proper functions do not permit. 
    Instead, at the top of the function - just below the existing definition of <code>mark</code>,
    define another variable named <code>mark</code> and initialise it to the value of <code>target</code> - because at the <i>start</i>
    of the function none of the letters has been used.</li>
    <li>
      Find the <i>two</i> places where <code>target</code> is currently referenced <i>within</i> the
        <el-method>markAttempt</el-method> function and edit them to refer to <el-code>unused</el-code>
        instead. You can make further use of the <el-method>setChar</el-method> that you wrote in the previous step.
    </li>
    <li>
    Within the <i>first</i> loop, underneath the instruction that
      sets the <code>mark</code>, add a new instruction to set the same character number in <code>unused</code> to a single
      <i>empty space</i>.

  <question>Has this fixed the failing 'Only yellows' test?</question>
  <question>Has it fixed any other failing tests?</question>
</step>
<step>
  <h1>Step STEPNUMBER: get all remaining tests passing</h1>
  There is still one 'Only yellows' test that is still failing - because the three <b>P</b>s in the attempt word
  are all being matched against the single <b>P</b> in the target word, which is incorrect - just the first 
  one should be marked as a yellow match. (We then have the 'Mixed' examples - containing both green and yellow matches to deal with!)
  To fix this we need to ensure that the <i>second</i> loop - managing the yellows matches - 
  <i>also</i> does not use a letter from the target word more than once. Within this loop, 
  underneath the instruction that sets the <el-id>mark</el-id>, add a new instruction
  that updates <el-id>unused</el-id>. Note, however, that this instruction will be
  different to the one you just wrote within the <i>first</i> loop. See if you can figure it out.

  <p>If you have implemented this step correctly, you should see that the last failing 'Only yellows' test is now passing.</p>
  <question>If so, what else do you notice about the test results?</question>
  </p>
</step>
<final>
  <p>Perhaps you were surprised that in fixing all the 'Only greens' and 'Only yellows' tests, the 'Mixed' tests
    also pass. This sort of bonus doesn't always happen, but it shows the benefits of having plenty of test cases.
    As a result of this:
    <ul>
      <li>Congratulations! You have completed the worksheet.</li>
      <li>You can now <b>run</b> the program again - and this time it will work correctly.</li>
    </ul>
    you will find that each time you run it the computer picks a different target work - selected at random
    from 2,309 valid answer words.

  <h3>Optional further work</h3>

  If you have time, you might like to consider undertaking one or more of the following suggested improvements/extensions:
  <b>Optional refinements</b>
  <ul>
    <li>You now have the option to <load file="wordle_1source.elan">Load the full source code</load>
       of the finished program. The initial constants are huge, so use the <b>Outline</b> button to make it easier to explore.
      This will allow you to see how it is implementing the functionality
       that you haven't written - for example the user-interface. 
       You can save this source code to your own local file and then modify it as you wish,
      for example to implement one of the following...</li>
    <li>Create a loop within <code>main</code> to allow the user to solve multiple puzzles in a row. 
      You might find this instruction useful: <code>call pressAnyKeyToContinue(true)</code></li>
    <li>Keep track of how many of the puzzles the user solved within six attempts, and how many were not solved.
      Print this at the end of the run e.g. 'You solved 7 out of 10 puzzles within six attempts'. Note that
      to get the results back to <code>main</code> from the <el-method>playGame</el-method> procedure
      you will need to use an <code>out</code> parameters. (See <b>Help > Language Reference > Global Instructions > Procedure</b>)</li>
    <li>For the puzzles successfully solved, keep track of the number of attempts taken and, at the end of the
      run of puzzle, calculate the average number of attempts, displayed to, say, 2 decimal places.</li>
    <li>Turn it onto a two player game, where each player enters their name, and each is asked to solve a puzzle in turn (with the target
      words being different for each). Show the cumulative scores for each.</li>
  </ul>
