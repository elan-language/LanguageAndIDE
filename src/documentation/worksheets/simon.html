  <p>In the classic hand-held electronic game, Simon:
  <img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)#/media/File:Simon_Electronic_Game.jpg">
  the device played sequence made up of 'moves' and the players task was to remember and reproduce
  the sequence. Each of the four possible moves had a different colour (red, yellow, blue, green)
  associated with a different physical position, and with a different audible tone. If the player
  reproduced the sequence correctly, the device played the sequence again with one more move added
  (the first sequence being just one move). Also, as the sequence lengthened, each moved was
  shown for a shorter duration. If the player makes a single incorrect move the game is over
  and the score reflects the longest length of sequence that the player reproduced correctly.</p>
  <p>You are now going to build a simulation of the Simon game, with the four colours shown
    as large circles in a row, complete with audible tones. The player will use the four numeric keys
    <b>1 2 3 4</b> to represent the moves - the numbers corresponding to the four positions in the row.</p>

  <p>We are going to make more than one use of a 'List' data structure in this program. A List works somewhat like an
    Array but - unlike an Array which is set to a fixed size - a List can be extended indefinitely
    (within in the limits of a computer's memory). A list can even start off empty and grow from there.</p>

  <h3>Iteration 1 - Draw a solid circle</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Start a new file and add a <el-kw>main</el-kw> routine. Within that add a <el-kw>let</el-kw>
      instruction, defining the name <el-id>circle</el-id> to be <el-field id="expr10" class="ok" tabindex="0"><el-txt><el-kw>new</el-kw> <el-type>CircleVG</el-type>()</el-txt><el-place><i>value or expression</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="Click to open Help for this field"><a href="documentation/LangRef.html#ExpressionField" target="doc-iframe">?</a></el-help></el-field>
      noting that the <el-type>VG</el-type> in <el-type>CircleVG</el-type> is short for 'vector graphic' which is
      a way to draw very high resolution graphics - with more flexibility and greater speed than is possible using
    Turtle graphics, for example.</li>
    <li>Follow this with:
      <el-code-block>
        <el-statement class="ok" id="call11" tabindex="0" title="Right-mouse-click or Ctrl-m to show context menu"><el-top><el-kw>call </el-kw><el-field id="ident12" class="ok" tabindex="0"><el-txt><el-method>displayVectorGraphics</el-method></el-txt><el-place><i>procedureName</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="Click to open Help for this field"><a href="documentation/LangRef.html#ProcRefField" target="doc-iframe">?</a></el-help></el-field>(<el-field id="args13" class="optional ok" tabindex="0"><el-txt>[<el-id>circle</el-id>]</el-txt><el-place><i>listOfVGs</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="Click to open Help for this field"><a href="documentation/LangRef.html#ArgListField" target="doc-iframe">?</a></el-help></el-field>)</el-top></el-statement>
      </el-code-block>

      noting that the square brackets used in <el-code>[<el-id>circle</el-id>]</li>]</el-code> defines a List -
      in this case a List with just one member - the circle. The procedure method 
      <el-method>displayVectorGraphics</el-method>, because in a typical application using VectorGraphics 
      would want to display multiple shapes - lines, circles, rectangles and more - at once, and we could
      just include them all within the square bracket, separated by commas. This application is unusual because
      we will be displaying just one circle at a time. We will be making a more interesting use of List later on.
    </li>
    <li>Run the application and note that it displays a circle in the centre of the <b>Display</b> - but
    why is it yellow, and what determined the size and position? It uses some default values - just so
    that you see something. Now we want to specify various properties of the circle.</li>
    <li>Select the second field in the <el-kw>let</el-kw> statement, and at the right hand end type 
       type <el-kw>with</el-kw> or select it from the drop-down options. You will now be presented with a 
      a list of the 'properties' that can be specified with for a circle. Select the first option, <el-id>centreX</el-id>
      then <b>Tab</b> to add the prompted words <el-kw>set to</el-kw> followed by the value <el-lit>15</el-lit> and a comma.
      Repeat this sequence to set the <el-id>centreY</el-id> to <el-lit>15</el-lit>, the <el-id>radius</el-id> to <el-lit>10</el-lit>,
      and the <el-id>strokeWidth</el-id> to <el-lit>0</el-lit> - so lose the black line around the circle.
      How do we know approximately what values to use?  The <b>Display</b> measures 100 units wide by 75 units deep, with coordinates
      0,0 being located at the top left, and 100, 75 bottom right. <br> Run the program again and confirm that a larger yellow circle, no edge appears near the top-left corner.</li>
