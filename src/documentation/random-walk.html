<title>Worksheet - Random Walk</title>
</head>
<body>
<div class="docTitle">Worksheet - Random Walk</div>

<p>If you have never programmed before, this worksheet is a great way to start.
And if you have previously done a little programming you might still find this exercise interesting.</p>

<p>Our objective is to investigate the mathematical idea of a 'random walk'. 
Imagine that you are standing in the centre of a circle with a radius of 10 paces.
But instead of walking straight to the edge, with each pace you make a random turn
- <i>up to</i> to 90 degrees left or right. How many paces will it take to reach the edge?
You might answer that it is 'Impossible to say, if the turning is truely random!', 
and that is correct, <i>for a single journey</i>: for example, the picture below shows 
three such possible random-walk journeys, and each takes a different number of paces:</p>

<img src="http://127.0.0.1:5500/out/website/documentation/images/random-walk.png" width="50%">

<p>But can we determine the <i>average</i> number of paces to reach the edge? Yes,
if we could perform the experiment many times. But, you might say, 'What's the point?'
Well, it turns out that being able to predict the average length of a different kinds of
random walk has very significant applications in many different fields of study: 
physics, biology, ecology, economics ..., even computer science. 
(You may read more about this on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>So let's get started.</p>

<h3>Iteration 1: Use 'Turtle graphics' to plot a non-random walk.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Your code editor pane should look like this (allowing that the Elan version number might be greater than shown here):

    <elan-code-block>
        <el-header># <el-hash>ec2a7054d8d0bdaefee304faa514c071ccee07e8250b73112263c5a92e0eb9a9</el-hash> <el-version>Elan 1.1.3</el-version> <el-user class="hide">guest</el-user> <el-profile class="hide">default_profile</el-profile></el-header>
        <el-global class="selected focused ok empty" id="select0" tabindex="0" title="Right-mouse-click or Ctrl-m to show context menu"><el-select><el-txt></el-txt><el-place>new code</el-place><el-help class="selector"> main procedure function test constant enum record class abstract interface #</el-help></el-select></el-global></div>
    </elan-code-block>
    if it doesn't then select <b>File > New > OK</b>. Also, if the background to this pane is not white, then the
    browser focus is somewhere else - just click with the mouse inside the code editor pane, <i>or</i> <b>Tab</b> until it has focus.</li>
    <li>We will start by creating a 'main' routine. You can see that <el-code>main</el-code> is one of the options offered in 
        the 'new code selector (the text with the grey background), 
    and the only one starting with <el-code>main</el-code>, so just pressing <b>m</b> to create the main routine:

    <el-code-block>
        <main class="ok multiline" id="main3" tabindex="0" title="Right-mouse-click or Ctrl-m to show context menu">
            <el-top><el-expand>+</el-expand><el-kw>main</el-kw><el-msg></el-msg><el-fr>1</el-fr></el-top>
            <el-statement class="selected focused ok empty" id="select4" tabindex="0" title="Right-mouse-click or Ctrl-m to show context menu"><el-select><el-txt></el-txt><el-place>new code</el-place><el-help class="selector"> call each for if let print repeat set throw try variable while #</el-help></el-select></el-statement>
            <el-kw>end main</el-kw>
        </main>
    </el-code-block></li>
    <li>The extent of main routine is defined by <el-kw>main</el-kw> and <el-kw>end main</el-kw> and it is currently empty, 
        but will eventually contain multiple 'instructions' which are, in the simplest case, executed in order - like a recipe.
        Currently, within the main routine there is another (grey) 'new code selector' showing the instructions that can be added <i>within the main</i>.</li>
    <li>Type the letter <b>l</b> and you will see the <i>incomplete</i> 'frame' for a <el-kw>let</el-kw> instruction:
        <el-code-block>
            <el-statement class="warning" id="let5" tabindex="0" title="Right-mouse-click or Ctrl-m to show context menu"><el-kw>let </el-kw><el-field id="var6" class="selected focused empty warning" tabindex="0"><el-txt><input spellcheck="false" data-cursorstart="0" data-cursorend="0" size="1" style="width: 2px" value=""></el-txt><el-place><i>name</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="A variable name must start with a lower-case letter, optionally followed by any letters (lower or upper case), and/or numeric digits, and/or underscores - nothing else. (For'tuple deconstruction' or 'list deconstruction' consult documentation.)">?</el-help></el-field><el-kw> be </el-kw><el-field id="expr7" class="empty warning" tabindex="0"><el-txt></el-txt><el-place><i>expression</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="Field may contain a literal value, a reference to a variable, or an expression">?</el-help></el-field><el-msg></el-msg></el-statement>
        </el-code-block>

</ul>
