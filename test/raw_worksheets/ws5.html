  <h3>Iteration 1: Draw a shape with 'turtle graphics'</h3>
  <h3>Purpose of this worksheet</h3>
  <p>Our objective is to investigate the mathematical idea of a 'random walk'.
    Imagine that you are standing in the centre of a circle with a radius of 10 paces.
    But instead of walking straight to the edge, with each pace you make a random turn
    - of <i>up to</i> to 90 degrees left or right. How many paces will it take to reach the edge?
    If the turning is truly random then each attempt will take a different number: the picture below shows
    three such paths taken:</p>

  <img src="../../../out/website/documentation/images/random-walk.png" width="50%">

  <p>Can we determine the <i>average</i> number of paces to reach the edge? Yes,
    if we could perform the experiment many times.
    And it turns out that being able to predict the average length of a different kinds of
    random walk has significant applications in many different fields of study:
    physics, biology, ecology, economics ..., even computer science. So we are going to build just such a
    simulation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure the code editor has focus i.e. has a white background.</li>
    <li>From the new code options, press <b>m</b> to create an empty <el-code><el-kw>main</el-kw></el-code> routine.</li>
    <li>Within the main routine add a <el-code><el-kw>let</el-kw></el-code> instruction, and edit its two fields to look like the
      following, making as much
      use as possible of the options offered in the drop-down list (by cursoring down to the chosen item and
      pressing <b>Enter</b>)
      because this reduces errors:

      <el-code><el-statement class="none" id='let4' tabindex="-1" ><el-kw>let </el-kw><el-field id="var5" class="selected focused ok" tabindex="-1"><el-txt><input spellcheck="false" data-cursorstart="0" data-cursorend="0" size="1" style="width: 1ch" value="t" tabindex="-1"></el-txt><el-place><i>name</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="Click to open Help for this field"><a href="documentation/LangRef.html#ValueDefField" target="help-iframe" tabindex="-1">?</a></el-help></el-field><el-kw> be </el-kw><el-field id="expr6" class="ok" tabindex="-1"><el-txt><el-kw>new</el-kw> <el-type>Turtle</el-type>()</el-txt><el-place><i>value or expression</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="Click to open Help for this field"><a href="documentation/LangRef.html#ExpressionField" target="help-iframe" tabindex="-1">?</a></el-help></el-field><el-msg></el-msg><el-fr>0</el-fr></el-statement></el-code></code><ul><el-code><el-global contenteditable spellcheck="false" class="selected focused ok empty" id='select0' tabindex="-1" ><el-select><el-txt></el-txt><el-place>new code</el-place><div class="options"> main procedure function test constant enum record class abstract interface #</div><el-help contenteditable="false" title="Click to open Help for any of these instructions"> <a href="documentation/LangRef.html#GlobalInstructions" target="help-iframe" tabindex="-1">?</a></el-help></el-select></el-global></el-code><ul><el-code><code>

    <li>We have named this turtle <el-code><el-id>t</el-id></el-code> - picking a short name because we will be referring to it often and
      isn't likely
      to be confused with anything else. We could have given it a longer name, and we will use longer names
      shortly. Names (also called 'identifiers') that we give
      to things always begin with a lower-case letter. You'll also note that identifiers and types are shown in
      different colours in the editor.
    </li>
    <li>The 'empty' brackets after <el-code><el-type>Turtle</el-type></el-code> are necessary, but don't worry about why they are needed just
      now
      that will gradually become clearer. Note also that if you selected <el-code><el-type>Turtle</el-type></el-code> from the drop-down
      options you
      will have seen a prompt (white characters) telling you that brackets were needed, like this:
      at which point just pressing <b>Tab</b> will insert the prompted characters.</li>
    <li>Whenever you see a question mark next to a field or instruction, clicking it will open the <b>Help</b> tab.
      This may be useful when you start to write your own programs, but shouldn't be necessary in this worksheet.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Follow this by adding this <el-code><el-kw>call</el-kw></el-code> instruction:

    <el-code><el-statement class="none" id='call4' tabindex="-1" ><el-top><el-kw>call </el-kw><el-field id="ident5" class="selected focused ok" tabindex="-1"><el-txt><input spellcheck="false" data-cursorstart="0" data-cursorend="0" size="5" style="width: 6ch" value="t.show" tabindex="-1"></el-txt><el-place><i>procedureName</i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="Click to open Help for this field"><a href="documentation/LangRef.html#ProcRefField" target="help-iframe" tabindex="-1">?</a></el-help></el-field>(<el-field id="args6" class="empty optional ok" tabindex="-1"><el-txt></el-txt><el-place><i><i>arguments</i></i></el-place><el-compl></el-compl><el-msg></el-msg><el-help title="Click to open Help for this field"><a href="documentation/LangRef.html#ArgListField" target="help-iframe" tabindex="-1">?</a></el-help></el-field>)<el-msg></el-msg><el-fr>0</el-fr></el-top></el-statement></el-code>

    Noting that:

    <ul>
      <li>This instruction can be verbalised as 'call the <el-code><el-id>show</el-id></el-code> procedure on the turtle t'.</li>
      <li>A procedure is a named piece of a code that makes a change to the system. This may also be referred to
        as a 'method' -
        a procedure being a particular type of method.</li>
      <li>This syntax - which takes the form of <i>nameOfThing.methodName</i> is known as a 'dotted method'.
        You'll be calling a
        lot of dotted methods on the turtle <el-code>t<code>.

  <li>Run the program, noting that:
    <ul>
      <li>the <b>Display</b> shows the turtle as a small green circle. When first created it is located in
        the centre of the <b>Display</b>, with the 'x,y' coordinates of 0,0.</li>
      <li>In turtle terms the <b>Display</b> measures 200 turtle units wide, and 150 turtle units deep.</li>
      <li>The short black line on the turtle shows that it is currently heading North.</li>
      <li>Having shown the turtle this program stops, so you can click on the code editor to give it focus
        and resume editing the code.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li><li>Add three more instructions below the <el-kw>call</el-kw>:
    <code>
      call t.move(10)
      call t.turn(45)
      call t.move(10)
     Code does not parse as Elan.</el-code>
        <ul>
          <li>Here we again calling two different procedure methods on the turtle, their names suggesting what
            the turtle will do.</li>
          <li>Both of these methods require you to specify a value (representing the distance to move, and the
            angle - in degrees - to turn, respectively)
            which is placed within the brackets. That's what the brackets are for when using a method.</li>
          <li>A value given to a method (within the brackets) is known as an 'argument' (the same term is used
            in Mathematics).
            Later we will encounter methods that require more than one argument. Some methods -
            <el-code><el-id>show</el-id></el-code> for example -
            don't require any arguments, but they still need the brackets.
          </li>
        </ul>

        then run the program again and make sure that you understand how the trail left by the turtle's pen
        corresponds to the three instructions that you added.

  <h3>Iteration 2 - Draw the circle with a radius of 10 paces</h3>

  <p>Returning to our problem we defined the specific random walk to be simulated as getting from the centre to the
    edge of a circle with a
    radius of 10 paces. We now know how to draw a regular polygon and a circle may be described as a regular polygon
    with an infinite number of sides.
    But since the display's resolution is not infinite we can get away with less than that! 360 sides, turning 1
    degree each time should suffice.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Modify the <el-kw>for</el-kw> loop so that it executes 360 times.</li>
