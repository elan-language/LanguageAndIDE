Elan (short for 'educational language' but is also an English word meaning 'flair', 'style' or 'panache') is a brand new programming language and integrated IDE, running within a browser.
Elan is specifically designed for teaching programming in schools - with a focus on ages 11-18 (that's Years 7 - 13, or KS3-KS5). It is a UK-based project, explicitly conceived to support both the needs and the constraints of Computer Science the British school-level education system, and uses English language with British spellings. It is the first new programming language to be designed with this intent since BBC Basic in 1981. 
Elan is multi-paradigm - meaning that it supports the procedural (PP), object-oriented (OOP), and functional (FP) programming paradigms.
