<p>Elan is a new programming language integrated into a unique development environment, both running as a single page app within a browser (Chrome is recommended, or Chromium on a Raspberry Pi).
    The language, environment, and teaching resources are all free.
    It may be run from the <a href="https://elan-lang.org">public site</a>, installed on your school/colleage web server, or installed and run on a standalone device with no need for a network connection.
</p>

<p>Elan is specifically designed for teaching programming in schools and colleges. 
    It places emphasis not just on learning how to program, but learning how to program <i>well</i>.</p>

<p>Elan supports the three most widely recognised programming paradigms:</p>

<ul>
    <li>procedural programming</li>
    <li>object-oriented programming</li>
    <li>functional programming</li>
</ul>

<p>and supports them all <i>well</i>. For example, unlike in most 'multi-paradigm' programming languages, Elan functions are always pure and side-effect free 
    - the most important pre-requisite for proper functional programming.</i></p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<ul>
    <li>A 'frame-based' code editor, that has the <i>look</i> of a text-based language and editor, but <i>feels</i> somewhat like a block-based language.
        As well as aiding productivity and reducing the need for typing skills, it <i>eliminates</i> the majority of syntax errors.</li>
    <li>A built-in library, the use of which requires no <el-code>import</el-code> statements.</li>
    <li>A display screen alongside the code editor, with the ability to output simple block graphics, turtle graphics, vector graphics, and formatted, styled Html</li>
    <li>A built-in debugger</li>
    <li>Teacher-managed 'profiles' for managing the availability of individual features (including specific language constructs) for groups, or even individual pupils.</li>
    <li>An in-built anti-plagiarism capability, optionally activitated by the teacher.</li>
    <li><i>Absolutely no AI</i> - so teachers and exam boards can be confident that pupils are not getting inappropriate help.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Team</h1>

<p>Elan was conceived by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardpawson">Richard Pawson</a> in May 2023. 
    The original design & development team consisted of Richard, Stefano Cascarini (lead technical developer), and John Stout.
    From the outset we have sought regular input and feedback from recognised experts in computer science education including: 
    <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/michael-kolling">Michael Kölling</a> and <a href="https://simon.peytonjones.org/">Simon Peyton Jones.</a>
    We are also reliant on volunteers to test the prototypes, write example programs, and assist with documentation and resources.
    We would like to thank, in particular Nela Brockington, Charles Wicksteed, and Bernard Boase for regular help of this kind.
    If you are able to assist in any way please get in touch...
